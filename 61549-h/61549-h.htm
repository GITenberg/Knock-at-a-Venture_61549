<h3><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>CHAPTER
I</h3>
<p>Where the sylvan character of the scene changes; where fields
give place to hanging woods and they in their turn thin to
poverty and obliquity under eternal stress of western winds, a
gate, resting by its own weight against a granite post, indicates
the limits of agriculture and forestry upon the southern confines
of the Moor.&nbsp; Beneath this standpoint Devon&rsquo;s
unnumbered breasts billow to the misty horizon, and dimpling
valleys, between the arable lands and higher wealds, are marked
by orchards, water meadows and the winding ways of rivers.&nbsp;
These, borne aloft, have come from far, and now, with slower
current and ampler volume, roam melodiously through pleasant
lees, through denes and dingles of sweet flowers, beneath the
music of birds and the shadows of great woodlands, to their
confluence with the sea.&nbsp; Here, too, lie hamlets and rise
crocketed church towers; peat reek sweetens the air; blue doves
croon through blue smoke on <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>many a low thatched cot; and life
moves in simplicity and apparent peace.&nbsp; The habitations of
men glimmer with white-washed walls at fringes of forests, at
wind-blown crossways, about small village greens, on lonely
roads, by steep hillsides and among sunny combes.&nbsp;
Homesteads rise in isolation along the edges of the great central
loneliness; whole villages lie in the lap of the hills; and the
manifold planes of this spacious scene, whether under flying
cloud-shadows or grey rain, midday sunlight or the splendour of
summer moons, commingle in one vision, whose particulars only
vary to the play of the dawn and sunset lights, to the hands of
the roaming elements, to the seasons that bring in turn awakening
life and music, high colour-pageants and dying pomps, ultimate
sobrieties and snows.</p>
<p>Beyond the gate to the Moor rises a steep road of broken
granite and flint.&nbsp; It climbs upward, straight and dogged,
into the world of the heather and, pursued a little, reveals the
solemn sweep and dip of the circumambient waste.&nbsp; To the
skyline tumbles this billowy ocean, and the ripples upon the
crest of each mighty wave are granite.&nbsp; Here rise the tors,
adorned at this August season with purple ling to their
footstools of stone; here subtend wildernesses between the high
hills; and the sheep bells jangle upon them, and the red kine
bellow from the watercourses.&nbsp; A rook, his feathers <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>blown awry,
hops thrice, then ascends heavily; but the kestrel, with greater
distinction of flight, glides away from his perch upon a stone,
ere he swoops aloft with long reaches, to hang motionless in the
air, like a brown star afar off.&nbsp; The moorland world extends
in vast, undulating mosaic of olive and dun, thinly veiled by the
bloom of the ling and splashed with golden furze and grey
granite.&nbsp; The expanse is touched to umber and velvet warmth
in sunshine; is enriched with the pure, cool purple of
cloud-shadows; is brightened into sheer emerald-green, where
springs burst from their peat-moss cradles amid seeding
cotton-grass; is lightened throughout its sombre heath tones with
glistening sheets of polished fern, where the tracts of the
bracken stand under direct sunlight.&nbsp; There is warmth of
colour in its breezy interspaces&mdash;warmth, won from the
ruddiness of ripe rush-heads and manifold grasses all bending and
swaying in waves under the wind.</p>
<p>At the junction of two roads, that cross at right angles
within a hundred yards of the moor-gate, there stands a
blackthorn of venerable shape.&nbsp; It is a deformed, grotesque
tree, much bent and shrivelled.&nbsp; Its boughs are coated with
close fabric of grey encrustations, but such clothing has failed
to protect its carcase against a century of winters and biting
winds.&nbsp; In autumn the scanty foliage is still <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>brightened by a
meagre crop of fruit; but life crawls with difficulty up the
zigzag bones of this most ancient thorn, while each spring its
tardy sap awakes less of the tree, and leaves increasing
concourse of abrupt and withered twigs to rot above and below the
centre of vitality.&nbsp; Beneath this ruin you shall note a
slight hillock of green grass, where foxgloves shake aloft their
purple pyramids of blossom and a rabbit&rsquo;s hole lies close
beside them.&nbsp; Of artificial barrow or modern burying-place
there is no suggestion here; and yet this mound by the highway
side conceals a grave; and the story of the human dust within it
is the truth concerning one who lived and smarted more than a
hundred years ago.&nbsp; Men were of the same pattern then as
now, but manners varied vastly; and the Moor-man, who farms upon
the grudging boundaries of that great central desert to-day, and
curses the winds that scatter his beggarly newtakes with
thistledown and fern seed, might wonder at the tales this same
wild wind could tell him of past times and of the customs of his
ancestors.</p>
<p>Human life on the Moor is still hard enough, but modern
methods of softening the rough edges of existence were even less
considered in the beginning of the century, when American and
French prisoners of war sorrowfully sighed at Prince Town.&nbsp;
In those days the natives of the Devonshire <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>highlands
endured much hardship and laughed at the more delicate nurture of
the townfolk, as the wandering Tuaregs laugh when their softer
fellows exchange tent and desert for the green oases of many
palms and sweet waters.&nbsp; Then food was rough on Dartmoor and
drink was rougher.&nbsp; Cider colic all men knew as a common
ill; most beverages were brewed of native herbs and berries; only
upon some occasion of rare rejoicing would a lavish goodwife
commission &ldquo;Johnny Fortnight,&rdquo; the nomad packman, to
bring her two or three ounces of genuine Cathay as entertainment
for her cronies.</p>
<p>It was rather more than a century ago that one, John Aggett,
dwelt within two hundred yards of the thorn-bush already
described; and the remains of his cottage, of which the
foundation and a broken wall still exist, may yet be seen&mdash;a
grey ghost, all smothered with nettles, docks and trailing
briars.&nbsp; A cultivated patch of land formerly extended around
this dwelling, and in that old-world garden grew kale and
potatoes, with apple trees, an elder, whose fruit made harsh
wine, and sundry herbs, used for seasoning meat or ministering to
sickness.&nbsp; No evidence of this cultivation now survives,
save only the ruined wall and a patriarchal crab-apple
tree&mdash;the stock that once supported a choicer scion, long
since perished.</p>
<p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>Here, a
mile or two distant from Postbridge in the vale of Eastern Dart,
resided John Aggett and his widowed mother.&nbsp; The cottage was
the woman&rsquo;s property; and that no regular rent had to be
paid for it she held a lucky circumstance, for John by no means
walked in his laborious father&rsquo;s footsteps.&nbsp; Work
indeed he could; and he performed prodigious feats of strength
when it pleased him; but it was not in the details of his prosaic
trade as a thatcher that he put forth his great powers.&nbsp;
Business by no means attracted him or filled his life.&nbsp; As a
matter of fact the man was extremely lazy and only when sports of
the field occupied his attention did he disdain trouble and
exertion.&nbsp; He would tramp for many miles to shoot plovers or
the great golden-eyed heath poults and bustards that then
frequented the Moor; he cared nothing for cold and hunger on
moonlight winter nights when wild ducks and geese were to be
slain; and trout-fishing in summer-time would brace him to days
of heroic toil on remote waters.&nbsp; But thatching or the
thought of it proved a sure narcotic to his energies; and it was
not until Sarah Belworthy came into his life as a serious factor
that the young giant began to take a more serious view of
existence and count the ultimate cost of wasted years.</p>
<p>Man and maid had known one another from early youth, and John
very well remembered the <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>first meeting of all, when he was a
lanky youngster of eleven, she a little lass of eight.&nbsp; Like
the boy, Sarah was an only child, and her parents, migrating from
Chagford to Postbridge, within which moorland parish the Aggetts
dwelt, secured a cottage midway between the home of the thatcher
and the village in the valley below.&nbsp; Soon afterward the
children met upon one of the winding sheep tracks that traverse
the Moor on every hand.&nbsp; They were upon the same business,
and each, moving slowly along, sought for every tress, lock or
curl of sheeps&rsquo; wool that hung here and there in the thorny
clutch of furze and bramble.</p>
<p>The boy stopped, for Sarah&rsquo;s great grey eyes and red
mouth awoke something in him.&nbsp; He felt angry because the
blood flowed to his freckled face; but she was cool as the little
spring that rose in their path&mdash;cool as the crystal water
that bubbled up and set a tiny column of silver sand shivering
among the red sundews and bog asphodels at their feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marnin&rsquo; to &rsquo;e,&rdquo; said John, who
already knew the small stranger by sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marnin&rsquo;, Jan Aggett.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; what might your name be, if I may
ax?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be called Sarah, but Sally most times; an&rsquo; I be
wool-gatherin&rsquo; same as you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hast-a got gude store?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>&ldquo;But little yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll shaw &rsquo;e all the best plaaces, if you
mind to let me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank &rsquo;e, Jan Aggett.&nbsp; My mother&rsquo;s a
gert spinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; my mother&rsquo;s a gert spinner
tu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so gert as mine, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never was better&rsquo;n my mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine be better, I tell &rsquo;e!&nbsp; Her spins black
wool an&rsquo; white together into butivul, braave grey yarn;
an&rsquo; auld Churdles Ash&mdash;him what&rsquo;s got the loom
to Widecombe, do buy it for money, wi&rsquo; gladness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ban&rsquo;t much black wool in these paarts; an&rsquo;
my mother knits her worsted into clothes for me.&nbsp; But
I&rsquo;ll share what I find with you now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lay I&rsquo;ll find a plenty for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lay you will.&nbsp; An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll shaw
&rsquo;e wheer the blackberries be in autumn time, an&rsquo;
wheer the best hurts be got out Laughter Tor way; an&rsquo; wheer
the properest rexens for cannel-making<a name="citation10"></a><a
href="#footnote10" class="citation">[10]</a> do graw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you&rsquo;m a very kind-fashioned bwoy, Jan
Aggett.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d best to call me just &lsquo;Jan,&rsquo;
like other folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I will; an&rsquo; you&rsquo;d best to call me
&lsquo;Sally.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burned if I doan&rsquo;t then!&nbsp; An&rsquo;
us&rsquo;ll be friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>From
that time forward the lonely children became close companions;
and when years passed and Sarah ripened to maidenhood, while John
brought forth a straw-coloured moustache and thick beard that
matched his sandy locks, the pair of them were already regarded
by their own generation as surely bound for marriage in due
season.</p>
<p>There came an afternoon when the girl had reached the age of
eighteen and John was just arrived at man&rsquo;s estate.&nbsp;
They worked together during harvest time, and the thatcher,
standing on a stack ladder, watched the girl where she was
gleaning and likened her pink sunbonnet to some bright flower
nodding over the gold stubbles.&nbsp; Presently she came to him
with a bundle of good corn under her arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis long in the straw this year,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must thresh it for me when you can and
hand me the straw for plaiting.&nbsp; I can sell all the hats
an&rsquo; bonnets tu, as I&rsquo;m like to weave.&nbsp; An&rsquo;
parson do allus give me half a crown each year for a new straw
hat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John came down from his perch and picked up the little
sheaf.&nbsp; Then, the day&rsquo;s work done, they dawdled up the
hill, and Sarah, hot and weary, after toil in great sunshine,
sometimes took John&rsquo;s hand, like a little child, when the
road revealed no other person.</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Up
through the lanes from the farm of Cator Court to the higher land
they made their way, crossed over the river nigh Dury and passed
beside a wall where scabious drew a sky-blue mantle over the
silver and ebony lichens of the granite.&nbsp; Pennyworts also
raised their little steeples from the interstices of the old
wall; briars broke its lines; red berries and black twinkled
among the grasses, and dainty cups and purses of ripe seeds
revealed their treasures; flowers not a few also blossomed there,
while butterflies gemmed the golden ragwort, and bees struggled
at many blossoms.&nbsp; A mellow murmur of life gladdened the
evening, and the sun, slow sinking behind distant Bellever,
warmed the world with rich horizontal light.&nbsp; At a break in
the stones dripped a stream in a little dark nest of ferns.&nbsp;
Here, too, stood a stile leading into heavy woods, and one
sentinel beech tree arose at the corner of a gamekeeper&rsquo;s
path through the preserves.&nbsp; Hither, weary with her labours
and desiring a brief rest, Sarah turned, climbed the stile, and
sat down beneath the tree.&nbsp; John accompanied her and they
reclined in silence awhile where the ripe glory of September
sunshine sent a shimmer of ruddy and diaphanous light into the
heart of the wood and flamed upon the bole of the great
beech.&nbsp; A woodpecker suddenly departed from the foliage <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>above the
silent pair.&nbsp; He made off with a dipping, undulatory motion
and cheerful laughter, as who should say, &ldquo;two is company
and three none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John turned to Sarah and sighed and shook his head while he
tickled her hand with a straw from the sheaf.&nbsp; She did not
withdraw it, so he came a little nearer and put the straw up her
arm; then followed it with two of his own fingers and felt her
moist skin under them.</p>
<p>She laughed lazily, and the music fired his heart and sluggish
tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, God, Sally, how long be I to dance upon your beck
and call for nought?&nbsp; How long be I to bide this way while
you hang back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Us couldn&rsquo;t be gerter friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ess fay, but us could.&nbsp; Wheer do friendship lead
to &rsquo;twixt men an&rsquo; women?&nbsp; Dost hear?&nbsp; I
knaw you&rsquo;m butivul to see, an&rsquo; purtiest gal in
Postbridge an&rsquo; such like; an&rsquo; I knaw a man o&rsquo;
my fortune an&rsquo; poor brain power&rsquo;s got no
right&mdash;an&rsquo; yet, though &rsquo;tis bowldacious so to
do, I ban&rsquo;t built to keep away from &rsquo;e.&nbsp; I peek
an&rsquo; pine an&rsquo; dwindle for &rsquo;e, I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dwindle,&rsquo; dear heart!&nbsp; Wheer&rsquo;s
the signs of that?&nbsp; You&rsquo;m stronger an&rsquo; taller
an&rsquo; better&rsquo;n any man on East Dart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did &rsquo;e say &lsquo;better,&rsquo; Sally?&nbsp; Did
&rsquo;e mean it?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a year since I fust axed
&rsquo;e, serious as a man, <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>an&rsquo; a dozen times &rsquo;twixt
then an&rsquo; now I&rsquo;ve axed again.&nbsp; I swear I thought
as I&rsquo;d seen love light in them misty eyes of thine, else
I&rsquo;d have troubled &rsquo;e less often.&nbsp;
But&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t I have sent &rsquo;e away wi&rsquo; a
flea to your ear when fust you axed, if I&rsquo;d meant all I
said, you silly gawkim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he put his arm round her and hugged her very close.&nbsp;
No artifice restrained the plump natural curves of her waist; her
garments were thin and the soft body of her beneath them fired
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give awver!&nbsp; You&rsquo;m squeezin&rsquo; me,
Jan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say it then&mdash;say it out&mdash;or I&rsquo;ll hug
&rsquo;e, an&rsquo; hug &rsquo;e, an&rsquo; hug &rsquo;e to death
for sheer love!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You gert thick-headed twoad!&nbsp; Caan&rsquo;t
&rsquo;e read awnly a woman&rsquo;s words to &rsquo;e?&nbsp;
Haven&rsquo;t &rsquo;e found out these long months?&nbsp;
Didn&rsquo;t &rsquo;e even guess how &rsquo;twas when we went
christening Farmer Chave&rsquo;s apple trees down-along by night,
an&rsquo; I slapped your face for comin&rsquo; to me arter
you&rsquo;d been fooling with that slammocking maypole of a gal,
Tom Chubb&rsquo;s darter?&nbsp; You&rsquo;m blind for all your
eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave an inarticulate grunt and poured huge noisy kisses on
her hair and face and little ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christ A&rsquo;mighty!&nbsp; Sweatin&rsquo; for joy I
be!&nbsp; To think it&mdash;to think you finds the likes o&rsquo;
me gude enough for &rsquo;e!&nbsp; Theer&mdash;theer.&nbsp;
Hallelujah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shouted and danced with the grace of a brown <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>bear, while
she smoothed herself from his salutations and sat up panting
after such rough embrace.&nbsp; Then he took out his knife and
sought the beech tree behind them.&nbsp; Sunset fires were dying
away.&nbsp; Only a starry twinkling of auburn light still caught
the high tops of the tallest trees and marked them out against
the prevailing shadows of the woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a deed should be cut on the first bark as
meets your eyes after the woman&rsquo;s said &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to
&rsquo;e,&rdquo; declared John.</p>
<p>Then, turning to the trunk where lichens painted pale silver
patterns on the grey, he set to work, at the height of a
man&rsquo;s heart, and roughly fashioned the letters &ldquo;S.
B.&rdquo; and &ldquo; J. A.&rdquo; with a scroll around them and
a knot beneath to indicate the nature of true love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Theer let it bide, sweetheart, for our childer&rsquo;s
childer to see when we&rsquo;m sleepin&rsquo;
down-along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away with &rsquo;e, Jan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently they moved onward to their homes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Braave news for my mother,&rdquo; said the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Braaver news for mine,&rdquo; declared John.</p>
<p>The sun had set and the twilight was in Sarah&rsquo;s grey
eyes as she lifted them to him.&nbsp; Together they passed
upward, very slowly, with her head against his shoulder and his
arm round her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a pleasant thing seemin&rsquo;ly to have a
huge gert man to love &rsquo;e.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>&ldquo;Ess fay, my bird!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll live to knaw
it, please God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From their lofty standpoint spread a wide scene of waning
light on a fading world; and above the eastern horizon, through
the last roses of the afterglow, imperceptibly stole a round
shield of pale pearl.&nbsp; Aloft the sleeping wind-clouds lost
their light and turned slate-grey as the misty phantom of the
moon gathered brightness, and the western nimbus of sunset faded
away.</p>
<p>Then John took his lips from his love&rsquo;s and gave her the
sheaf of gleaned corn and left her at her father&rsquo;s door,
while he tramped on up the hill.</p>
<p>His mother trembled before the long-anticipated truth and knew
the first place in his heart was gone at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As purty as a pictur in truth,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;but something too taffety <a name="citation16"></a><a
href="#footnote16" class="citation">[16]</a> for the wife of a
day labourer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; answered the man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;m an angel out o&rsquo; heaven, an&rsquo;
she&rsquo;ll come to be the awnly wife worth namin&rsquo; on
Dartymoor.&nbsp; For that matter she ban&rsquo;t feared of a
day&rsquo;s work herself, an&rsquo; have awftentimes earned a
fourpenny piece &rsquo;pon the land.&rdquo;</p>

17</span>CHAPTER II</h3>
<p>Throughout the week Samson Belworthy, the father of Sarah,
swung a sledge and followed a blacksmith&rsquo;s calling at
Postbridge; upon the day of rest his labours were of a more
delicate sort, for he played the bass viol and pulled as good a
bow as any musician around about the Moor.&nbsp; This man
accepted John as a suitor to his daughter with certain
reservations.&nbsp; He had no mind to dismiss Sally into poverty,
and bargained for delay until Aggett had saved money, obtained
regular occupation, instead of his present casual trade, and
arrived at a worldly position in which he could command a cottage
and thus offer his wife a home worthy of her.</p>
<p>From desultory application to the business of his dead
father&mdash;a sort of work in which he had never much
distinguished himself&mdash;John now turned his face upon the
problems of life in earnest, and sought employment under a
responsible master.&nbsp; His ambition was to win a place as
gamekeeper or assistant keeper on the estates of the manor lord;
but he lacked the necessary qualifications in the opinion of
those who knew him; being <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>indeed strong enough, courageous
enough, and familiar enough with the duties of such a calling,
but having an uncertain temper, by nature fiery as his own
freckled skin in summer-time.&nbsp; Finally, his physical
strength obtained for him daily work and weekly wage at Farmer
Chave&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Into the establishment of Believer Barton he
entered, and, as cowman, began a new chapter of his life.</p>
<p>All proceeded prosperously during the autumnal progress of his
romance.&nbsp; John gave every satisfaction, was said to have
forgotten his way to the sign of the &ldquo;Green Man&rdquo; at
Postbridge, and certainly developed unsuspected capabilities in
the direction of patience and self-control.&nbsp; He toiled
amain, attracted his master&rsquo;s regard and won the red-hot
friendship of his master&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>This youth, by name Timothy, returning from his apprenticeship
to a brewer at Plymouth after futile endeavours to master that
profitable business, decided to follow in his father&rsquo;s
footsteps, much to the elder&rsquo;s disappointment.&nbsp;
Timothy Chave elected to be a farmer, however, and coming home a
fortnight before Christmas, he devoted his days and nights to the
pleasure of sport as a preliminary to the tremendous application
he promised when the new year should come.&nbsp; He was two years
younger than John Aggett and a youth of higher intelligence and
finer clay; but he <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>found in John an ideal follower by flood and
field.&nbsp; There came a day, one week before the Christmas
festival, when for particular reasons Tim desired a heavy
bag.&nbsp; John was therefore begged off his farm duties, and the
young men, rising by starlight, trod the high land and pressed
forward before dawn toward Aggett&rsquo;s familiar haunts.</p>
<p>Young Chave, a lad of good repute and handsome exterior, had
learned his lessons at Blundell&rsquo;s School, was accounted a
very clever youth, and held in much esteem as a traveller and a
scholar amidst the natives of Postbridge.&nbsp; His mother
spoiled him and fooled him to the top of his bent; his father had
been proud of him until the lad&rsquo;s recent determination to
soar no higher than the life of a countryman.</p>
<p>This present excursion bore reference to a special event, as
has been said.&nbsp; There were coming from North Devon to
Believer Barton, for the holiday season, sundry poor cousins of
the Chaves.&nbsp; On Christmas Eve they would arrive, and, as a
certain pretty damsel of seventeen was to accompany her elders,
Timothy&rsquo;s generous heart determined that moorland
delicacies must await her, if his right arm, long fowling-piece
and liver-coloured spaniel could secure them.&nbsp; With this
excuse he had won John Aggett away from the cow-byres, and
together, as day broke, they passed southward <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>to Dartmeet,
held on by Combestone Tor and presently tramped into the lonely
and desolate fastnesses of Holne Moor.&nbsp; Here, with cautious
passage across half-frozen swamps, the sportsmen sought their
game.</p>
<p>To the progress of that day no part of this narrative need be
devoted; suffice it that we meet the men again coming homeward
under an early, universal twilight and a cold northern
wind.&nbsp; In certain marshes, rumoured to send forth warm
springs even at dead of frosty nights, John Aggett had found good
sport, and now from the servant&rsquo;s waist-girdle a big bag
bulged with two brace of teal, three snipe, two woodcock and a
hare.&nbsp; Through the grey promise of coming snow they pushed
homeward where the wind wailed a sad harmony in the dead heath,
and all the ground was very hard save upon the black bogs that
froze not.&nbsp; John was clad as the Kurds and Mountain Syrians
to this day; he wore a sheep&rsquo;s pelt with the hair toward
his body, the skin turned out.&nbsp; Arms of like material fitted
into this snug vest, and his breeches were similarly
fashioned.&nbsp; Timothy, as he faced the north wind booming over
a heather ridge, envied Aggett, for his own garments, albeit
stout enough, lacked the warmth of the natural skin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colder and colder,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and the last
drop of sloe gin drunk and five good miles before us
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis so; but theer&rsquo;s Gammer
Gurney&rsquo;s cot down along in a lew place under Yar Tor.&nbsp;
If you mind to turn out of the way a bit, &rsquo;tis certain
she&rsquo;ll have gude, heartening liquors hid away, though how
she comes by the fiery stuff, an&rsquo; the tobacco her sells in
secret, an&rsquo; the frill-de-dills o&rsquo; precious silks
an&rsquo; foreign lace-work ban&rsquo;t my business to
knaw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll pay Gammer a visit.&nbsp; My
father gets many a gill of brandy from the old rascal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In league wi&rsquo; the Dowl, I doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More likely with the smugglers.&nbsp; Plenty of cargoes
are run down Teignmouth way, and when they&rsquo;ve dodged the
gaugers and made a good haul, the farther they take their wares
inland the better.&nbsp; She pays them well, be sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She do awften talk &rsquo;bout a sailor son, come to
think on&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, many and many a sailor son, I warrant you!&nbsp; My
father says her cognac is drink for the gods; yet if they are
pleased to make him a Justice of the Peace, then he will adopt
different measures with Mother Gurney, for a man&rsquo;s
conscience must be set above his stomach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her be a baggarin&rsquo; auld sarpent for sartain,
an&rsquo; goeth through the air on a birch broom or awver the sea
in a eggshell, an&rsquo; many such-like devilries.&nbsp; In times
past I judge the likes o&rsquo; she would burn <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>for such dark
wickednesses; though her did me a gude turn once, I&rsquo;ll
allow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While speaking, they had rounded the ragged side of Yar Tor,
and then proceeding, passed to the north by some ancient hut
circles of the old stone men.&nbsp; Following a wall, where the
hill sloped, they found themselves confronted with the
bird&rsquo;s-eye view of a lonely, thatched cottage.&nbsp; Below
it the land sank with abruptness; before the entrance extended a
square patch of garden.&nbsp; No sign of life marked the spot;
but as the men climbed down a pathway through withered fern, they
aroused a bob-tailed, blue-eyed sheep-dog which leapt, gaunt and
apelike, to the limit of its tether and barked wildly at the
intruders.&nbsp; A naked austerity, a transparent innocence and
poverty, marked the spot to casual eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down these winding ways, or else out of the woods
below, come Mother Gurney&rsquo;s &lsquo;sailor sons&rsquo; with
their packs and barrels hid under innocent peat and rushes, no
doubt,&rdquo; commented Timothy.</p>
<p>Then John Aggett knocked at the door with a modest tap and
young Chave noted that he spat over his left shoulder before
doing so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis plaguey hard to be upsides wi&rsquo; a
witch, I do assure &rsquo;e; but she&rsquo;m a wonnerful clever
woman, as all in these paarts do very well knaw,&rdquo; confessed
John.</p>
<h3><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>CHAPTER III</h3>
<p>Gammer Gurney dwelt quite alone and none had seen the alleged
mariner her son, for the occasions of his visits were hidden in
nocturnal mystery.&nbsp; Upon one point at least no doubt
existed: the dame could vend choicest cognac to a favoured few at
a shilling a pint; and those whom it concerned also knew that no
such tobacco as that she sold, whether for smoking or chewing,
might be otherwise procured nearer than Exeter.&nbsp; There was a
whisper, too, of French silks and laces, concerning which the
wives of the quality could have told a tale; and gossips of that
district were prepared to swear upon the Book how more than once
in moments of high excitement Gammer Gurney had uttered words and
whole sentences of words in a heathen tongue.&nbsp; Yet, despite
her powers and accomplishments, she always went her humble rounds
with an old donkey in an older cart.&nbsp; Ostensibly she
purchased rags and bones and other waste from farm kitchens; and
those who knew not her peculiarities and pitied her lean
apparition in its iron pattens, old sunbonnet and
&ldquo;dandy-gorisset&rdquo; gown, would give her cast-off
garments and orts from the table to keep life in her.&nbsp;
Others, <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>better informed, well understood what was hidden in the
donkey cart, and Gammer came as an honoured if a secret guest to
many a great house on the countryside.&nbsp; Indeed half a
hundred sea-dogs were her sons, and the smugglers thought a
ten-mile tramp over Dartmoor no hardship when the Gammer&rsquo;s
great discretion and the liberality of her prices for matters
contraband came to be considered.&nbsp; In addition to these dark
practices Mother Gurney was reputed a witch in her own right, but
a witch of the better sort&mdash;a white wonder-worker, whose
marvellous knowledge enabled her to combat the black necromancers
that haunted Devon in those days to the detriment of honest
folk.&nbsp; Their power of the evil eye; their unpleasant habit
of overlooking innocent men and women, was quelled and crushed by
Gammer&rsquo;s stronger if less sinister charms.&nbsp; To gain
private ends, she fostered this vulgar opinion concerning her
accomplishments; was much rapt in secret studies and claimed wide
skill in medicaments and cures by drug and amulet for beast and
man.&nbsp; Recoveries, indeed, were laid at her door with frank
thankfulness; though whether the moorland herbs and rare simples,
ostentatiously plucked at times of old moons and eclipses, were
to be thanked so much as that ingredient of strong French brandy
which entered into her prescriptions, may be left a matter of
conjecture.</p>
<p><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>Upon
the door of Gammer Gurney&rsquo;s mysterious home John Aggett
knocked, then a little nut-brown woman opened to him, nodded
without affectation of superior parts, and even curtseyed in
old-fashioned style at sight of Timothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your sarvant, young maister,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Be pleased to step in, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;m welcome,
I&rsquo;m sure, though &rsquo;tis the home of poverty.&nbsp; Rest
free, if that&rsquo;s your errand&mdash;rest; an&rsquo;
theer&rsquo;s a gude cushioned chair to hold &rsquo;e tu, though
you mightn&rsquo;t count to find such here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The white witch had no peculiarities.&nbsp; She merely
suggested a venerable and time-worn body whose life had not
lacked tribulations and whose tether must be near at hand.&nbsp;
But her dark eyes were very bright and her activity of body was
still apparent.</p>
<p>Timothy lolled in the great &ldquo;grandfather&rdquo; chair
and a red peat glow flamed on his leather gaiters from the fire;
John sat near the door with a wandering and uneasy eye, ready to
discover mystery and read secrets at every turn.&nbsp; He knew
that to ask openly for the cordial he desired had been to make a
hole in his manners.&nbsp; He therefore waited for his master to
speak.</p>
<p>Gammer Gurney mended the fire and chattered briskly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Theer&rsquo;ll be little more huntin&rsquo; &rsquo;pon
the high <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>Moor &rsquo;fore the snaw come.&nbsp; An&rsquo;
&rsquo;tis near now.&nbsp; It be given me to knaw &rsquo;bout
what fashion weather us may look for by the birds an&rsquo;
berries, by the autumn colour of leaves, by tokens hid in still
waters an&rsquo; the callin&rsquo; of the cleeves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reds was in the sky this marnin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said
John, &ldquo;a savage, sulky sunrise, I warn &rsquo;e.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seed un; an&rsquo; a terrible braave sight of snaw
unshed in the elements; an&rsquo; the airth ripe for it.&nbsp;
Gert snaw an&rsquo; ice be comin&rsquo;, wi&rsquo; sorrowful deep
drifts an&rsquo; death to man an&rsquo; beast, an&rsquo;
awfullest floods to follow arter.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve knawn this
many days an&rsquo; laid in store against it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Timothy now saw his opportunity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m going to add to that store if
you&rsquo;ll let me.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a fine hare in the
bag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hare, did &rsquo;e say?&nbsp; They&rsquo;m dark,
fanciful beasts, an&rsquo; if I was anything but a honest woman,
I&rsquo;d not touch no such thing.&nbsp; But I knaw what I
knaw.&nbsp; Wheer did &rsquo;e find un?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shot un,&rdquo; said John, dragging the animal
forth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Her was sittin&rsquo; aquott under a tussock
nigh Horn&rsquo;s Cross on Holne Moor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then &rsquo;tis a pure, natural beast wi&rsquo; no dark
tricks to un, if &rsquo;twas theer.&nbsp; A witch hare
wouldn&rsquo;t go in them plaaces.&nbsp; A right hare&mdash;sure
enough, an&rsquo; heavy tu.&nbsp; Thank &rsquo;e kindly;
an&rsquo; if you comes round arter Christmas I&rsquo;ll cure the
skin for &rsquo;e, Jan <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>Aggett.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill make a
proper cap against the hard weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John scraped and offered respectful thanks; then refreshments
became the subject of Timothy Chave&rsquo;s speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t a cup of milk by you, mother?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m thirsty as a fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Milk&mdash;ess fay; but none for you.&nbsp; Ban&rsquo;t
drink for grawed men, if you ax me.&nbsp; But
I&rsquo;ve&mdash;well, no call to name it.&nbsp; Yet &rsquo;tis a
wholesome sort o&rsquo; tipple took in reason an&rsquo; took
hot.&nbsp; You bide here.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be back direckly
minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She disappeared through a low door at the side of the kitchen
and locked it behind her.&nbsp; In five minutes she returned with
the promised refreshment and poured it from a square earthenware
crock into two large cups.&nbsp; These she half filled with
brandy, then added hot water from a kettle, and finally dropped a
lump of yellow candy into each, with mingled spices from a
shining black box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twill do &rsquo;e a power o&rsquo; gude
an&rsquo; keep away evil an&rsquo; make heroes of
&rsquo;e,&rdquo; declared the woman.&nbsp; Then she watched the
drinking men, with pleasure in her bright eyes, and shewed that
she appreciated their grunts and gurgles of satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better&rsquo;n milk?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A godlike brew!&rdquo; declared Timothy; and John, who
had waited to see his master drink first <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>before
venturing upon the witch&rsquo;s gift, now gave Gammer Gurney the
compliments of the blessed season with all respect, then drained
the last drop of his refreshment and scraped out the remaining
spice and sugar with his fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I feels like a mighty man o&rsquo; Scripture
compared to what I was a bit ago,&rdquo; he declared, as the
spirit moved him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d make your fortune if you set up a sign in a
city and sold that stuff to all buyers,&rdquo; prophesied
Timothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wants no fortune, Maister Chave.&nbsp; I be here, an
auld sawl well thought &rsquo;pon an&rsquo; wi&rsquo;in call
o&rsquo; friends.&nbsp; I tell no tales an&rsquo; breed no
troubles, an&rsquo; what goes in my ear doan&rsquo;t come out at
my mouth wi&rsquo; a new shape to it, I assure &rsquo;e.&nbsp; No
tale-bearer me.&nbsp; Tongue an&rsquo; ear
strangers&mdash;that&rsquo;s the wise way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;m wise enough, ma&rsquo;am; everybody knaws
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I set up for anything above my neighbours,
though I may have done &rsquo;em a gude service here an&rsquo;
theer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A many of &rsquo;em&mdash;Lard, He knaws how
many,&rdquo; declared John, eagerly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Taake my awn
case.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t &rsquo;e tell me how to win my maid for
a silver sixpence, an&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t I do as you bid
an&rsquo; worrit her marnin&rsquo;, noon an&rsquo; night till she
said the word?&nbsp; <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>An&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t Digory
Crampiron, the shepherd, come to &rsquo;e &rsquo;pon the same
cause an&rsquo; ax what fashion woman &rsquo;twas as he&rsquo;d
best pay court to?&nbsp; An&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t you say
her&rsquo;d be a dark maid?&nbsp; An&rsquo; sure enough dark her
was; an&rsquo; a gude wife an&rsquo; mother these many days
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the thing I&rsquo;d like to hear!&rdquo;
cried Timothy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Read me riddles, Gammer.&nbsp; Tell
me my fate in marriage, and when the girl is coming, and what
she&rsquo;ll be like.&nbsp; Tell me, and I&rsquo;ll give thee a
golden guinea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now it fell out, strangely enough, that the white witch knew
certain facts hidden from her questioner&mdash;facts that none
the less concerned him in some measure.&nbsp; She had that
forenoon visited Bellever Barton to find the household of the
farm in some confusion.&nbsp; The Christmas guests had arrived
three days earlier than they were expected; that circumstance
being explained by an opportunity to travel cheaply to
Moretonhampstead on a stage-coach, some of whose passengers had
failed it.&nbsp; From Moreton to Postbridge was no great matter,
and the male travellers had ridden that distance, bringing their
luggage on a packhorse and their ladies upon pillions behind
them.&nbsp; In the bustle and confusion caused by this premature
advent, Gammer Gurney was kept waiting in the
buttery&mdash;treatment very rarely extended to her <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>dignity.&nbsp; But this delay had not been wasted.&nbsp;
A garrulous housekeeper explained circumstances to the old woman
and added that one of the newcomers, a girl of a fair face,
reserved manners and great good sense, had won Farmer
Chave&rsquo;s heart, and was by him secretly destined for Timothy
without that young man&rsquo;s knowledge.&nbsp; This maiden the
Gammer had seen and spoken with before she departed homeward; but
as for Tim, he knew nothing of the business.&nbsp; Thus it may be
guessed what excellent matter for a prophecy was now at the hand
of the white witch.&nbsp; Indeed, she had oftentimes done
miracles in the public esteem with less promising material.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, this circumspect woman shewed no eagerness to take
young Chave at his word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best to think twice &rsquo;fore you ax me that,&rdquo;
she answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a serious deed, boy, and
not to be undertaken in a light spirit.&nbsp; Mind this tu: the
truth ban&rsquo;t always sweet or what our ears are best tuned
for hearin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her respectful manner vanished upon the introduction of this
theme.&nbsp; She now spoke as the young man&rsquo;s
superior.&nbsp; Timothy was not frightened from his purpose,
however, and screwed his face into solemnity.&nbsp; Then he
winked behind Gammer Gurney&rsquo;s back at John Aggett, who,
knowing well how witches have eyes behind and before, doubted not
<a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>that the
action had been observed and was much discomfited in
consequence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your guinea, mother; that&rsquo;ll shew
you I&rsquo;m in solemn earnest upon this matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wise woman instantly swept up the coin.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
you will, you will,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>As a preliminary to the fortune reading, two rush candles were
lighted and the table cleared.&nbsp; Then upon it the sibyl drew
a half circle with black charcoal and spread ancient cards round
the circumference.&nbsp; Next she set up in the midst a lump of
shining quartz, of the sort known as Cornish crystal, and into a
natural cup within this stone she poured the black contents of a
small, strangely shaped bottle.&nbsp; Now, bidding them be silent
and motionless, with impenetrable gravity she went upon her knees
beside the table and so remained for a long five minutes.&nbsp;
Sometimes she gabbled to herself, sometimes she set her hands
upon a conjunction of the outspread cards; but her eyes, as it
appeared, never closed for a moment and never for a moment
wandered from the little black lake in the quartz
discerning-glass.</p>
<p>John, deeply impressed, sat with his mouth open; and even the
scholar felt his scepticism waning a trifle.</p>
<p>Presently Gammer Gurney began to talk, and after much
moonshine and a whole rigmarole of <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>promises, predictions and cautions,
the witch broke off and scanned the crystal with increased
intensity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terrible coorious!&rdquo; she murmured in an audible
aside.&nbsp; &ldquo;No such thing as this ever happened afore, I
should judge.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the day of the month?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eighteen of December,&rdquo; said John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exacally so!&nbsp; An&rsquo; if&mdash;theer!&nbsp; Of
all straange fallings-out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gazed blankly at her guest until Timothy, despite his
education at Blundell&rsquo;s, grew a little uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, what&rsquo;s amiss, mother?&nbsp; Out with
it for good or ill.&nbsp; What pitfall is waiting for me&mdash;an
early marriage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A maiden be waitin&rsquo; for &rsquo;e, Timothy Chave;
an&rsquo; this very day&mdash;a grey-eyed young girl wi&rsquo;
bright hair an&rsquo; cherry lips&mdash;this day&mdash;by picture
an&rsquo; by crystal!&nbsp; She&rsquo;m nearer than the coming
snow&mdash;she&rsquo;m at your elbow, man!&nbsp; Ess fay, first
young woman as you see an&rsquo; speak with come the
owl-light&mdash;her an&rsquo; none other will be your lifelong
mate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merciful to me!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis &rsquo;most owl-light
now!&rdquo; gasped John Aggett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By St. George, and the dragon too, I&rsquo;m near my
fate then!&nbsp; Up and off, John!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll see my bride
before nightfall.&nbsp; Come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman huddled up her cards, cleaned the <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>table and
poured the black liquid into the fire.&nbsp; Timothy was eager to
be gone, and now took an abrupt leave of his soothsayer; while as
for Gammer Gurney, she stood like one in a dream and regarded Tim
with vacant eyes.&nbsp; It was her custom thus to appear elevated
in the spirit after exercise of her remarkable gifts.&nbsp; So
they left her at her cottage door and started for home at a good
pace.&nbsp; The fresh air contributed much to blow superstition
out of Timothy&rsquo;s mind; but his companion continued taciturn
and was evidently impressed by what he had seen and heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She gave I goose-flesh down the spine, for all her
outlandish fiery drink,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fool, John; an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m a
greater.&nbsp; A good guinea wasted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nearing home, they turned off the Moor, passed the cottage of
Aggett&rsquo;s mother, and proceeded along the hill.&nbsp; Then
it was that John, desiring to shift the game-bag from his girdle
to his shoulder, hung back some forty paces.&nbsp; His fingers
were cold and the buckle was stiff; his master therefore gained
upon him and, passing the corner of a plantation, went out of
sight.&nbsp; Mending his pace to overtake the other, John heard
hidden voices, the hour then being dusk; and, a moment later,
coming round the corner of the woodlands, he saw Timothy Chave in
conversation with a woman.&nbsp; She was clad in <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>scarlet
flannel even to the snug hood round her ears, and her figure
shone brightly through the gloaming.</p>
<p>He heard words half laughing, half annoyed, in the
girl&rsquo;s uplifted voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who be glazin&rsquo; at then?&nbsp; Make way,
caan&rsquo;t &rsquo;e?&nbsp; Do &rsquo;e think I be a ghost out
the wood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it!&nbsp; A good fairy, more likely.&nbsp;
And forgive me; I wanted so much to hear you speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;m a very impident chap then, for all your
gert gashly gun awver your shoulder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman passed Timothy light footed, then, turning quickly
down a lane, she disappeared, just as John joined his
master.&nbsp; The young man was in an extremity of
excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God!&nbsp; Did you see her&mdash;that red
girl?&nbsp; An&rsquo; after what the hag said!&nbsp; Her eyes,
man!&nbsp; Eyes like stars in the dark and a voice like the wood
doves!&nbsp; I came straight upon her peeping out of her red
hood, like the queen of pixies!&nbsp; Who is she, John?&nbsp;
Who&rsquo;s her father?&nbsp; And where has she vanished
to?&nbsp; Speak if you know.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a marvellous
miracle of a thing that I should meet her in this way.&nbsp; I
could swear I was dreaming; yet I&rsquo;m as much awake as she
was alive.&nbsp; Who in the name of wonder is she?&nbsp; Speak if
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;m a maiden by the name of Sarah Belworthy,
darter o&rsquo; Smith Belworthy; an&rsquo; she&rsquo;m tokened to
me,&rdquo; said Aggett, stolidly.</p>
<h3><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<p>John&rsquo;s announcement awoke a laugh in the younger man,
and Timothy dismissed the subject with a sort of lame apology;
but the other remained dumb after his assertion, and few more
words passed between them.&nbsp; Aggett, however, burnt within,
for the recent incident had caused him infinite uneasiness and
alarm.&nbsp; To allay these emotions he hastened to the home of
Sarah as soon as his duties at the farm were ended, and there,
before her parents, rated her in round terms for speaking to a
strange man under the darkness.&nbsp; The girl&rsquo;s mother
heard of what had happened with secret interest; Sarah herself
laughed, then cried, and finally made her peace with many
promises that no light action in this sort should ever again be
brought against her.&nbsp; Of the white witch and the prediction
John did not speak; and though he returned to his loft above the
cows a comforted man, yet, in the hours of night, fear and
foreboding gripped his heart again and frank terror at the shadow
of an awful catastrophe made him toss and sweat in the
darkness.&nbsp; Twice he rose and prayed childish prayers that
his mother had taught him.&nbsp; They were <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>nothing to
the purpose, yet he trusted that they might call the
Almighty&rsquo;s attention to him and his difficulties.&nbsp; So
he lay awake and scratched his head and puzzled his scanty brains
with what the future held hidden.</p>
<p>As for Timothy, the splendid twilight vision of Sarah in her
red array was by no means dimmed by the subsequent appearance of
his own fair kinswoman.&nbsp; A first fiery love had dawned in
him, and the romantic circumstances attending its awakening added
glamour to the charm of mystery.&nbsp; Already he almost granted
Gammer Gurney a measure of the powers she pretended to.&nbsp;
Aggett&rsquo;s statement had iced his ardour for a while; but a
bitter-sweet yearning and unrest grew again after the cowman was
gone&mdash;grew gigantic to the shutting out of all other things
feminine; and Sarah&rsquo;s grey eyes, not his little
cousin&rsquo;s, were the lamps that lighted Timothy&rsquo;s
midnight pillow.</p>
<p>In the morning he gave himself great store of practical and
sensible advice.&nbsp; He told himself that he was too good a
sportsman to interfere with another&rsquo;s game and poach on
another&rsquo;s preserve; and he assured himself that he was too
excellent a son to fall in love with a blacksmith&rsquo;s
daughter and sadden his mother&rsquo;s declining days.&nbsp; He
laughed at himself, and, when he met John after breakfast, spoke
no more of the incident.&nbsp; He grew <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>self-righteous toward noon and was
secretly proud of himself for having withstood the fascination of
Sarah Belworthy&rsquo;s face and voice with such conspicuous
ease.&nbsp; He told his conscience that the fancy was already
dead; he felt that it would be interesting to meet the girl
again; and he assured himself that her image in full, garish
daylight must doubtless fall far below the perfection that it
suggested half veiled under coming darkness.&nbsp; During that
afternoon he marvelled a little at his own restlessness, then
sought occupation and decided that it would be well to have his
horse&rsquo;s shoes roughed.&nbsp; He knew under this explicit
determination lurked implicit desire to see the father of Sarah
Belworthy, but he did not give his mind time to accuse him.&nbsp;
He looked to his horse himself; he was very busy and whistled and
addressed those he knew about him, as he trotted down to the
smithy, feebly trying to deceive himself.</p>
<p>A black cavern gaped out on the grey day, and from within came
chime of anvil and hoarse breath of bellows.&nbsp; But it was not
the spluttering soft red-hot iron that caught Tim&rsquo;s
eye.&nbsp; A lurid figure appeared and disappeared like magic as
each pulse of the bellows woke a flame that lighted up the
forge.&nbsp; This vision now gleamed in the blaze, then faded as
the fire faded, and Timothy knew it for his pixie queen of the
preceding night.&nbsp; Such an <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>unexpected incident unnerved him; for
a brief moment he thought of riding on; but he had already drawn
rein and now dismounted, his heart throbbing like the fire.</p>
<p>Sarah had brought her father some refreshments from home, and
was amusing herself, as she had often done before, with the great
leathern bellows, while a lad worked at the anvil and the smith
rested from his labour and ate and drank.</p>
<p>Smith Belworthy gloried more than common in two possessions;
his daughter and his bass viol.&nbsp; Sometimes he mentioned one
first, sometimes the other.&nbsp; To-day, having greeted Tim with
great friendship and not forgetting the incident of the previous
night, he bid Sarah step forward, much to her mortification, and
drew young Chave&rsquo;s attention to her as though she had been
some item in an exhibition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darter, young sir, Sally by name.&nbsp;
Theer&rsquo;s a bowerly maid for &rsquo;e!&nbsp; An&rsquo; so
gude as she&rsquo;m purty; an&rsquo; so wise as she&rsquo;m gude
most times.&nbsp; Awnly eighteen year auld, though all woman, I
assure &rsquo;e.&nbsp; But tokened, maister&mdash;tokened to a
sandy-headed giant by name of Jan Aggett&mdash;her awnly silly
deed, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best fellow in the world,&rdquo; said Timothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe, but who be gude enough for the likes o&rsquo;
she?&nbsp; My li&rsquo;l rose of Sharon her be; an&rsquo; the <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>husband as
I&rsquo;d have chose should have been somebody, &rsquo;stead of
nobody.&nbsp; But theer she is, an&rsquo; I lay you&rsquo;ve
never seed a purtier piece in all your travels, have &rsquo;e
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blacksmith grinned affectionately, held Sarah&rsquo;s arm
in his grimy grip and surveyed his daughter as he had gazed upon
some prize beast or a triumph of the anvil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doan&rsquo;t heed un,&rdquo; burst out Sally, her grey
eyes clouded, and her face as red as her gown.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never
did no girl have such a gert gaby of a faither as me.&nbsp; His
wan goose be a royal swan, an&rsquo; he do reckon all the
countryside must see wi&rsquo; his silly eyne an&rsquo; think
same as him&mdash;fond auld man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cold light of day and the forge-glow struck her face
alternately as she moved.&nbsp; Young Chave was a man and not a
stock or a stone.&nbsp; Therefore he seized the hour and answered
her remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t blame your father for telling the
truth, young mistress,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Even though
it suit you not to hear it.&nbsp; Yet when &rsquo;tis so pleasant
and so generally accepted, it might well be agreeable to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Theer&rsquo;s butivul scholar&rsquo;s English,&rdquo;
chuckled Mr. Belworthy; &ldquo;theer&rsquo;s high
gen&rsquo;leman&rsquo;s language, an&rsquo; the case in a
nutshell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sarah grew shy and uncomfortable.&nbsp; Angry she could not be
before Tim&rsquo;s compliments, and how <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>to answer him
without contradicting him she did not know.&nbsp; So she turned
to her father instead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be gwaine to eat an&rsquo; drink up your food or
ban&rsquo;t &rsquo;e, faither?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All in gude time.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got to rough the
young gen&rsquo;leman&rsquo;s horse&rsquo;s shoes
fust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be in no hurry,&rdquo; said Tim.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can
wait awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t then,&rdquo; declared Sarah,
ungraciously, and so marched off in a fine flutter of mingled
emotions.</p>
<p>Mr. Belworthy looked up from the hoof between his knees and
winked with great significance at Timothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kittle cattle&mdash;eh?&nbsp; Look at the walk of
her!&nbsp; Theer ban&rsquo;t another girl this side Dartymoor as
travels like that.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis light as a bird, an&rsquo;
you&rsquo;d doubt if her&rsquo;d leave a footprint &rsquo;pon
new-fallen snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Diana walked,&rdquo; declared Tim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did her?&nbsp; A Plymouth maiden, I
s&rsquo;pose?&rdquo; asked Mr. Belworthy, with simulated
indifference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;a goddess of ancient times&mdash;just a
moonbeam shadow, you know.&nbsp; Not a splendid flesh and blood
beauty like your daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no sound but the rasping of the file; then Belworthy
spoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tokened to a man as&rsquo;ll never rise much beyond
Bellever Barton cow yard&mdash;that&rsquo;s the mischief of <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>it.&nbsp;
Her, as might have looked so high, seein&rsquo; as the body of
her an&rsquo; the faace of her be what they be.&nbsp; Not a word
&rsquo;gainst the chap, mind.&nbsp; Brains is the gift of God, to
be given or held back according to His gude pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a clever girl, too, I&rsquo;ll warrant.&nbsp; What
did she see in John Aggett, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clever in a way, though not so full of wit as my cheel
might have been prophesied.&nbsp; Me bein&rsquo; generally
reckoned a man of might on the bass viol Sundays.&nbsp; But
Sally&rsquo;s just Sally, an&rsquo; I wouldn&rsquo;t change an
eyelash of her.&nbsp; Power over musical instruments ban&rsquo;t
given to women-kind, I reckon; though for plain singin&rsquo;
wi&rsquo; other maidens in a plaace o&rsquo; worship, she&rsquo;m
a tower o&rsquo; strength.&nbsp; An&rsquo; she be just a polished
corner o&rsquo; the temple prayer-times, no matter what
gentlefolks comes theer.&nbsp; As to why she took on wi&rsquo;
Jan, I lay her couldn&rsquo;t give &rsquo;e reasons any
more&rsquo;n me.&nbsp; But so &rsquo;tis, an&rsquo; though it
mayn&rsquo;t never come to axing out in church, yet lovers be
stubborn in their awn conceits.&nbsp; An&rsquo; so&mdash;you
being Farmer Chave&rsquo;s awn son an&rsquo; heir&mdash;might, if
you was that way minded, up an&rsquo; say a word for
Jan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I will then.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a right good
fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the season o&rsquo; herald angels, when
hearts are warm, you see.&nbsp; An&rsquo; six shillin&rsquo; a
week do taake a terrible long time to goody.&nbsp; Of course, Jan
gets <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>cider, an&rsquo; corn at market price tu; yet
wi&rsquo;out offence &rsquo;tis tail corn most times an&rsquo;
not stomachable&mdash;stuff as doan&rsquo;t harden
muscle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father would never give his men tail corn,&rdquo;
cried Timothy, indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t he?&nbsp; Then I was wrong.&nbsp; I
wouldn&rsquo;t go against un for all the tin hid on
Dartymoor.&nbsp; But theer &rsquo;tis.&nbsp; I doan&rsquo;t see
how the man&rsquo;s gwaine to save against a wife an&rsquo;
fam&rsquo;ly unless his wage be bettered.&nbsp; An&rsquo; I
don&rsquo;t want to see my darter grow into an auld virgin
mumphead while he&rsquo;s tryin&rsquo; to scrape brass enough to
give her a home.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis wisht work such
waitin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not forget John Aggett.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a
very well-meaning man, and honest, and a splendid
shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he is then, an&rsquo; a gude shot as you say, though
I&rsquo;ll allus be sorry as he brought down my li&rsquo;l
bird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she loves him, &rsquo;twill fall out all right, you
know, Belworthy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If love could taake the place o&rsquo; victuals
an&rsquo; a stone cottage an&rsquo; a snug peat hearth, it might
fall out right; but I&rsquo;m sorry for the maiden&rsquo;s love
as have got to burn at full pitch o&rsquo; heat year arter year
wi&rsquo; marriage no nearer.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a withering thing
for a girl to love on, knawin&rsquo; in her secret heart as each
winter doan&rsquo;t pass awver her for nought but leaves its awn
touch o&rsquo; coldness an&rsquo; greyness.&nbsp; She hides it
from the man, o&rsquo; course&mdash;from <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>everyone else
tu, for that matter,&mdash;but &rsquo;tis with her all the
seasons through an&rsquo; dims her eye, an&rsquo; furrows her
smooth young forehead at night-times unbeknawnst to them that
love her best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Timothy doubted not that the blacksmith spoke truth, then he
trotted off up the hill, and without set purpose overtook Sarah
on her way home.&nbsp; Her voice and the frankness of her face
thrilled him as she smiled shyly, her temper gone.&nbsp; Again
she chid him for listening to her parent&rsquo;s nonsense, and he
tried to assume a friendly, fatherly manner toward her, and
failed.&nbsp; The girl made his blood burn and his hand shake on
his horse&rsquo;s mane.&nbsp; His breath came short, his eyes
grew bright, and only with difficulty did he arrest a frantic,
reckless petition for a kiss at any cost.&nbsp; Perhaps such an
abrupt and volcanic climax had been best; but he restrained
himself, swallowed his ardour and became humble before her.&nbsp;
Seeing that she preferred this attitude, he sank to servility;
then, rating him for wasting his time and her own, she turned
away hard by her cottage door, and he, without formal farewell,
walked his horse onward all a-dreaming.&nbsp; Sarah, too, was not
unmoved, but she hid her emotion and was glad that neither her
mother&rsquo;s nor any other pair of eyes had seen her with young
Chave.</p>
<p>Timothy met the third party to that unfolding drama as he
proceeded on to the Moor.&nbsp; Then came <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>John Aggett
with an anxious face looking out upon the world above his pale
beard.&nbsp; The labourer stopped Tim, and in broken
sentences&mdash;like a child that wrestles to describe new things
within his experience but beyond his vocabulary&mdash;strove
clumsily to express a mental upheaval which he lacked words to
display.&nbsp; He made it clear, however, that he was in a great
turmoil of mind and much driven by fear of appearances in
connection with Gammer Gurney&rsquo;s predictions of the previous
night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be just come from speech with the old woman, and
can&rsquo;t say as &rsquo;twas sense or yet nonsense I got out of
her.&nbsp; She kept a close watch on her lips, &rsquo;peared to
me; but her eyes threatened bad things an&rsquo; her
weern&rsquo;t at ease.&nbsp; &lsquo;What will happen, will
happen,&rsquo; she sez to me; an&rsquo; at the fust utterance it
seemed a deep sayin&rsquo;, yet, come to think on&rsquo;t,
&rsquo;twas a thing known so well to me as she.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you go to her?&rdquo; enquired Timothy, knowing
without need of answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Bout last night.&nbsp; Couldn&rsquo;t banish it
from my head what her said as to your sweetheart.&nbsp; So I went
an&rsquo; telled her how you met my Sarah an&rsquo; axed if that
comed in the spell, seein&rsquo; the girl were tokened to another
man.&nbsp; An&rsquo; she said as it might be or might not be,
because the spoken word remained an&rsquo; was no more to be
called back again than last year&rsquo;s primrosen.&nbsp; Then I
axed her what <a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>her view of it might be, an&rsquo; she up an&rsquo; said
what I told &rsquo;e; &lsquo;What will happen, will
happen.&rsquo;&nbsp; Arter that I grew hot an&rsquo; said any
fule knowed so much, an&rsquo; she turned round &rsquo;pon me
like a dog you&rsquo;ve trod on by mistake, an&rsquo; her eyes
glinted like shinin&rsquo; steel, an&rsquo; I reckoned she was
gwaine to awverlook me theer an&rsquo; then.&nbsp; So I cleared
out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happens, happens, because it must.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s all right enough, John.&nbsp; And things won&rsquo;t
fall out differently because we take thought and pine about
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be keepin&rsquo; comp&rsquo;ny, an&rsquo; it may be a
sort o&rsquo; state as blinds the eyes,&rdquo; said Aggett,
humbly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I trust &rsquo;e in this
thing&mdash;you&rsquo;m a gen&rsquo;leman, an&rsquo;
wiser&rsquo;n me, as be a mere zawk for brains alongside
you.&nbsp; But theer &rsquo;tis, she&rsquo;m my awn maid,
an&rsquo; if the &rsquo;mazin&rsquo; butivul looks of her have
fired &rsquo;e, then, as you&rsquo;m a gude man, so I pray
you&rsquo;ll be at trouble not to see her no more.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis very well to say what must fall, must; but the future
did ought to be a man&rsquo;s sarvant, I reckon, not his
master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not philosophic, John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, if theer&rsquo;s danger in my maid to you, then
turn your back upon her.&nbsp; I sez it wi&rsquo; all respects as
man to master; an&rsquo; as man to man, I&rsquo;ll say more,
an&rsquo; bid you be a man an&rsquo; look any way but that.&nbsp;
Ess fay, I sez it, though not worthy to hold a cannel to
&rsquo;e.&nbsp; An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s more, I trust
&rsquo;e.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>To
Timothy&rsquo;s relief John did not delay for an answer to his
exhortation, but proceeded upon his way.&nbsp; So they parted, by
curious chance, at that spot where to-day there rise the mound
and aged thorn.&nbsp; The Moor was of a uniform and sullen iron
colour under a sky of like hue but paler shade.&nbsp; The north
wind still blew, but the clouds were lower, denser and heavy with
snow.&nbsp; Even as Aggett went down the hill and his rival
proceeded upward, there came fluttering out of the grey the first
scattered flakes of a long-delayed downfall.&nbsp; They floated
singly, wide-scattered on the wind; others followed; here a
monstrous fragment, undulating like a feather, capsized in the
invisible currents of the air.&nbsp; Then the swarm thickened and
hurried horizontally in puffs and handfuls.&nbsp; The clean black
edges of the distant Moor were now swept and softened with a mist
of falling snow; aloft, thicker and faster, came the flakes,
huddling and leaping out of nothingness and appearing as dark
grey specks against the lighter sky.&nbsp; Presently indication
of change marked the world, and a glimmer of virgin white under
on-coming gloom outlined sheep tracks and made ghostly the grey
boulders of the Moor.&nbsp; By nightfall the great snow had
fairly begun, and blinding blizzards were screaming over the Moor
on the wings of a gale of wind.</p>
<h3><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>CHAPTER V</h3>
<p>Before the snows melted and the first month of the new year
had passed by, John Aggett and his master&rsquo;s son were
friends no more.</p>
<p>Of Timothy it may be recorded that he fought fiercely, then
with waning strength, and finally succumbed and lost his
battle.&nbsp; By slow degrees his intimacy with Sarah grew.&nbsp;
Neither sought the other; but love dragged them together.&nbsp;
The man hid it from his small world, or fancied that he did so;
the girl blushed in secret and knew that what she had mistaken
for love was mere attachment&mdash;an emotion as far removed from
her affection for Timothy as the bloodless moonbeams from the
flush of a rosy sunrise.&nbsp; A time came, and that quickly,
when she could deceive herself no longer, and she knew that her
life hung on her lover, while the other man was no more than a
sad cloud upon the horizon of the future.</p>
<p>Frosts temporarily retarded the thaw, and Timothy and Sarah
walked together at evening time in a great pine wood.&nbsp; A
footpath, ribbed and fretted with snakelike roots, extended here,
and moving along it they sighed, while the breath of the great <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>trees bore
their suspirations aloft into the scented silence.&nbsp; One band
of orange light hung across the west and the evening star
twinkled diamond-bright upon it, while perpendicularly against
the splendour sprang the lines of pine trunks, dimmed aloft with
network of broken and naked boughs, merging above into a sombre
crown of accumulated foliage.&nbsp; Cushions of dead needles were
crisp under foot and the whisper of growing ice tinkled on the
ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis vain to lie&mdash;at least to you an&rsquo;
to myself.&nbsp; I love &rsquo;e, Tim; I love &rsquo;e wi&rsquo;
all my poor heart&mdash;all&mdash;all of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her breath left her red lips in a little cloud and she hung
her head hopelessly down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God can tell why such cruel things happen,
dearest.&nbsp; Yet you loved him too&mdash;poor chap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the difference &rsquo;tween
thinkin&rsquo; an&rsquo; knowin&rsquo;&mdash;a difference wide as
the Moor.&nbsp; I never knowed love; I never knowed as theer was
such a&mdash;but this be wicked talk.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve winned
the solemn truth out o&rsquo; me; an&rsquo; that must content
&rsquo;e.&nbsp; I never could ax un to give me up&mdash;him so
gude an&rsquo; workin&rsquo; that terrible hard to make a home
for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will the home be when you&rsquo;ve got it?&nbsp;
Some might think it was better that one should suffer instead of
two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t leave him, out of pity.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>&ldquo;You must think of yourself, too, Sarah&mdash;if
not of me.&nbsp; I hate saying so, but when your life&rsquo;s
salvation hangs on it, who can be dumb?&nbsp; John Aggett&rsquo;s
a big-hearted, honest man; yet he hasn&rsquo;t our deep feelings;
it isn&rsquo;t in him to tear his heart to tatters over one woman
as I should.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Us can&rsquo;t say what deeps a man may have got hid in
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but we can&mdash;in a great measure.&nbsp;
John&rsquo;s not subtle.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s made of hard stuff and
sensible stuff.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll fathom him at any rate.&nbsp; It
must be done.&nbsp; He shall know.&nbsp; God forgive me&mdash;and
yet I don&rsquo;t blame myself very much.&nbsp; I was not
free&mdash;never since you came into my life and filled it up to
the brim.&nbsp; He saw the danger.&nbsp; I confess that.&nbsp; He
warned me, an&rsquo; I bade him fear nothing.&nbsp; I was strong
in my own conceit.&nbsp; Then this happened.&nbsp; The thing is
meant to be; I know it at the bottom of my being.&nbsp; It was
planned at creation and we cannot alter it if we
would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis well to say that; but I reckon poor Jan
thought the same?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see him; I&rsquo;ll speak with him man to
man.&nbsp; He must give you up.&nbsp; Oh, if I could change
places with him and find myself a labourer just toiling to make a
home for you, I&rsquo;d thank the Lord on my knees!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d never seen either of &rsquo;e, for
I&rsquo;ve awnly <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>made the both of &rsquo;e wretched men.&nbsp; Better
I&rsquo;d never drawed breath than bring this gert load of sorrow
upon you an&rsquo; him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t help it; you&rsquo;re innocent, and the
punishment must not fall upon your shoulders.&nbsp; You love me
better than Aggett; and that he must know in justice to
himself&mdash;and us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then his life be ruined an&rsquo; his cup bitter for
all time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, Sarah.&nbsp; You misjudge
him.&nbsp; And even if this must be so, it is only Fate.&nbsp; I
will speak to him to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave it a little while.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m fearful to
trembling when I think of it.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis I must tell him,
not you.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis I must tell him I&rsquo;m not faithful
an&rsquo; beg for forgiveness from him.&nbsp; An&rsquo; if he
struck me down an&rsquo; hurted me&mdash;if he killed
me&mdash;I&rsquo;d say &rsquo;twas awnly fair
punishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never would lift a finger, even in his
rage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jan?&nbsp; Never&mdash;never.&nbsp; A fiery soul, but
so soft-hearted as a li&rsquo;l cheel.&nbsp; Ess fay, &rsquo;tis
from me he should hear it, if he must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be better that I should do this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before they reached the stile, that stood under the great
beech tree, each loving coward had prayed the other to leave the
task alone; and finally both promised to do nothing for a short
space.&nbsp; Then into the light they came, and Sarah, glancing
upward, saw <a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>dim letters and a lovers&rsquo; knot like sad eyes
staring from the tree trunk.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, there existed no great need to impress
the situation upon John Aggett.&nbsp; The man, if slow-witted,
was not blind, and, indeed, agile enough of intellect where Sarah
was concerned.&nbsp; For many days he had hesitated to read the
change in her.&nbsp; His visits to her had been marked by gloomy
fits of taciturnity, by short speeches, abrupt leave-takings, by
distrust in his eyes, by rough mumbled sentences she could not
catch, by outbursts of affection, by sudden hugs to his heart, by
searching, silent scrutiny of her features and numberless
reiterations of one question.&nbsp; He never wearied to hear her
declare that she loved him; his only peace of mind was in the
moments of that assurance daily repeated; and he approached to
absolute subtlety in appraisement of Sarah&rsquo;s voice and
vocal inflection as she made answer.&nbsp; Until the present, her
affirmation of love had rung truly upon his ear; now he felt a
shadow behind the words and steeled himself to the change.&nbsp;
Her lips said one thing; her voice and eyes another.&nbsp; He
grew slowly to believe the signs and to realise that she loved
him no more, or if a little, so little that she did not mind
lying to him.</p>
<p>Over this earthquake in his life he brooded bitterly enough,
yet the stroke of it, upon first falling, was in some measure
broken by his knowledge of <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>Timothy&rsquo;s interview with Gammer
Gurney.&nbsp; A fatalistic resignation arose from this
recollection and manifested itself, for the brief space of a
week, in John&rsquo;s attitude to his fate.&nbsp; But as the
nature of all he had lost and how he had lost it beat upon his
brain, a great agony of reality soon caused him to brush the
white witch and her predictions out of the argument; they were
factors too trivial to determine the careers of men and women;
and thus, from beneath the smoke of his brief apathy appeared a
consuming fire, and the man&rsquo;s passionate nature cried for a
speedy and definite end to his torments.</p>
<p>Work upon the land was suspended under frost; but from the
great barn in Bellever Barton came daily a hurtling of flails
where threshing of barley kept the hands busy for many hours in
each brief day.&nbsp; The flails gleamed like shooting stars
across the dusty atmosphere of the barn, and when the sunlight
entered, a sort of delicate golden cloud hung in the air, only to
sink slowly away upon cessation of labour.&nbsp; Timothy Chave,
too, laboured here.&nbsp; For something to occupy him he swung a
flail with the rest, and made the old hands think better of
themselves and their skill within sight of his clumsy
efforts.&nbsp; Then it happened that Aggett, awake to an
opportunity, suddenly desisted from work, pulled on his coat and
accosted his rival.&nbsp; But he spoke for Tim&rsquo;s ear alone
and challenged no general attention.</p>
<p><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>&ldquo;Set down your drashel an&rsquo; come an&rsquo;
speak wi&rsquo; me a minute t&rsquo;other side the
yard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, John, if you wish it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later the meeting that Sarah had dreaded came about;
but the results of it were of a sort not to have been
anticipated.&nbsp; Aggett went straight to the point of attack
and his temper suffered from the outset before the more cultured
man&rsquo;s attitude and command of words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You knaw full well what I&rsquo;ve got to say before I
sez it, I judge.&nbsp; I see in your face you know, Timothy
Chave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s about Sarah.&nbsp; Things
that must happen, must happen.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve
broached this subject, Aggett.&nbsp; Well, it stands thus; we are
not our own masters always, unfortunately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can say that an&rsquo; look me in the face calm as
a stone, arter what passed between us six weeks ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six weeks&mdash;is that all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ess fay, though more like six years to me&mdash;six
years o&rsquo; raging, roasting hell.&nbsp; Why do &rsquo;e bide
here?&nbsp; Why do &rsquo;e take walks along wi&rsquo;
she&mdash;skulking in the woods away from honest eyes like a
fox?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve lied to me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak quite so loud, John.&nbsp; I cannot
help the past.&nbsp; It was not my doing.&nbsp; I never sought
out Sarah.&nbsp; We are all tools in the hand of Fate or
Providence, or whatever you like to call it; we are puppets <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>and must
dance to the tune God is pleased to play.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re not
free, any of us&mdash;not free to make promises or give
undertakings.&nbsp; Doesn&rsquo;t this prove that we&rsquo;re
slaves to a man?&nbsp; I love Sarah Belworthy with all my heart
and soul.&nbsp; That is not a sin.&nbsp; There is nothing in the
world for me but her.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m frank enough to you now;
and if I lied before, it was because I thought I could control
what was to come.&nbsp; I tried to keep my word.&nbsp; I turned
from her path many times.&nbsp; I begged to be allowed to go away
from the Moor, but my father would not suffer me to change my
mind again.&nbsp; I swear I did my best; but loving is another
matter.&nbsp; I might as easily have promised not to breathe as
not to love her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Words!&nbsp; An&rsquo; her&mdash;an&rsquo;
me&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s cursedly hard.&nbsp; God knows I don&rsquo;t
find it easy to answer you.&nbsp; But think: picture yourself in
her place.&nbsp; Imagine that you found a woman you loved better
than Sarah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis allus lifting of the burden on to other
folks&rsquo; shoulders wi&rsquo; you.&nbsp; I ban&rsquo;t agwaine
to imagine vain things at your bidding.&nbsp; Dost hear me?&nbsp;
I want the plain truth in plain speech.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s
more&rsquo;n you could give me, I reckon.&nbsp; The question
I&rsquo;ve got to ax, my girl&rsquo;s got to answer.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; I call her &lsquo;my girl,&rsquo; yet, until I hear
from her awn lips she ban&rsquo;t my girl no more.&nbsp;
Then&mdash;then&mdash;Christ knaws what&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s any sort of satisfaction on earth,
I&rsquo;d <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>give it to you.&nbsp; I know better than you can tell me
that I&rsquo;m a weak man.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ve hated myself for
many days when I thought of you; but there it is&mdash;a fact
beyond any mending.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out of her life, if you&rsquo;re honest, an&rsquo;
doan&rsquo;t whine to me &rsquo;bout things being beyond
mendin&rsquo;!&nbsp; Go!&nbsp; Turn your back on her an&rsquo;
let the dazzle of &rsquo;e fade out of her eyes an&rsquo; out of
her mind.&nbsp; You knaw so well as me, that it ban&rsquo;t
beyond mendin&rsquo;.&nbsp; She promised to marry me &rsquo;fore
ever she seed the shadow of you; an&rsquo; you knawed it from the
fust moment you set eyes on her; an&rsquo; yet you went on
an&rsquo; sinked from manhood into this.&nbsp; You&rsquo;m a
whole cowardice o&rsquo; curs in the skin o&rsquo; one man, damn
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do right to curse.&nbsp; You will never feel
greater contempt for me than I do for myself.&nbsp; I cannot go
away.&nbsp; It is impossible&mdash;wholly above my
strength.&nbsp; And the position is beyond mending, despite what
you say&mdash;both for Sarah and for me.&nbsp; It is no crime in
her to love me; the fault is mine, and if I had sworn on my hope
of salvation to you, I should have broken my oath as I did my
promise.&nbsp; Measure my punishment&mdash;that is all you can
do; and I won&rsquo;t flinch from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She loves you&mdash;better&rsquo;n what she do
me?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s come to that; an&rsquo; you ax me to measure
your punishment!&nbsp; You pitiful wretch!&nbsp; You know
you&rsquo;m safe enough now.&nbsp; She loves you better&rsquo;n
me.&nbsp; Theer&rsquo;s <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>your safety.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Struth!&nbsp; I could smash your bones like rotten wood,
an&rsquo; you know it; but she loves you better&rsquo;n me;
an&rsquo; who be I to crack her painted china wi&rsquo; my rough
cloam?&nbsp; I doan&rsquo;t love her no less&mdash;anyways not so
little as to bruise you, an&rsquo; that you knowed afore you
spoke.&nbsp; Get out o&rsquo; my sight an&rsquo; may worse fall
on you than ever I would bring.&nbsp; May the thing you&rsquo;ve
done breed an&rsquo; bite an&rsquo; sap the heart out of &rsquo;e
like a canker worm; may it bring thorns to your roses, an&rsquo;
death to your hopes, an&rsquo; storms to your skies; may it fill
your cup wi&rsquo; gall an&rsquo; bend your back afore your time
an&rsquo; sting you on your death-bed.&nbsp; May it do all that,
an&rsquo; more, so as you&rsquo;ll mind this hour an&rsquo; know
if I&rsquo;d scatted your lying brains abroad an&rsquo; killed
&rsquo;e, &rsquo;twould have been kinder than to let you
live!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have deserved your hardest words; but forgive
her&mdash;now that you yield her up; forgive her if ever you
loved her, for the fault was none of hers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can think for her, can &rsquo;e?&nbsp; You can
stand between me an&rsquo; her to shield her against the man as
would have faced fire an&rsquo; water an&rsquo; all hell&rsquo;s
delights for her ever since she was a li&rsquo;l dinky
maid!&nbsp; You ax me to forgive her&mdash;you?&nbsp; Christ
A&rsquo;mighty! she&rsquo;m a lucky woman to have a man of your
metal to stand up for her against me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that, Aggett; only I
feared&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doan&rsquo;t I love her tu, you smooth-faced
fule?&nbsp; <a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

I&rsquo;ve got to live my life wi&rsquo;out her; I&rsquo;ve got

could.&nbsp; Ban&rsquo;t her sin that you poured magic in her
cup; ban&rsquo;t her sin that she won&rsquo;t wear glass beads no
more now she thinks she&rsquo;ve found a strong o&rsquo;
di&rsquo;monds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a better man than I am, John; you make me
see what I&rsquo;ve done; you make me wish I was dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Liar!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t prate no more to me.&nbsp; I
hate the filthy sight of &rsquo;e, an&rsquo; the sound of thy
oily tongue.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d swing for &rsquo;e to-morrow,

Tell her&mdash;no, that I&rsquo;ll do myself.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll

<p>He departed, and the other, in misery and shame, stood and
watched him return to the threshing-floor.&nbsp; Yet, as the
unhappy spirit who has sacrificed his life to a drug and creeps
through shame and contumely back and back to the poison, counting
nothing as vital that does not separate him therefrom, so now the
man felt that Sarah Belworthy was his own and told himself that
his honour, his self-respect, his fair repute were well lost in
exchange for this unexampled pearl.</p>
<h3><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>CHAPTER VI</h3>
<p>At nightfall John Aggett visited the cottage of the
Belworthys, but Sarah was from home for the day and he had a few
words with her mother instead.&nbsp; That astute woman was well
informed of affairs, and the romance now proceeding had long been
the salt of her life, though she pretended no knowledge of
it.&nbsp; In common with her husband, she hoped for glory from a
possible union between the cot of Belworthy and the homestead of
the Chaves.&nbsp; But these ambitions were carefully hidden from
sight.&nbsp; All the smith said, when the matter was whispered,
amounted to a pious hope that the Lord would look after his
own&mdash;meaning Sarah; but presently it behooved both parents
to stir in the matter, when they learned of the subsequent
meeting between their daughter and John Aggett.&nbsp; A very
unexpected determination on the girl&rsquo;s part resulted from
that occasion, and the matter fell out in this way.</p>
<p>Before seeing John again, Sally had lengthy speech with her
new sweetheart, and he, a little dead to the danger of so doing,
detailed at length his conversation with the cowman and explained
the complete nature of his rival&rsquo;s renunciation.&nbsp; This
narrative set <a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>Timothy in a somewhat sorry light, and the fact that he
unconsciously bore himself as a victor added to the unpleasant
impression conveyed.&nbsp; Had Tim declared his own sorrow and
shame, blamed himself and acknowledged John&rsquo;s greatness
with wholehearted or even simulated praise, the girl had accepted
the position more readily; but as it was, young Chave, whose fear
of rousing her pity for John rendered him less eloquent upon that
theme than he felt disposed to be, by this very reticence and
oblivion touching the other&rsquo;s profound sorrow, awoke that
pity he desired to stifle.&nbsp; Indeed, his story moved Sarah
unutterably.&nbsp; While her love for Tim was the light of her
life, yet at this juncture her nature forced her to turn to the
first man, and now she held herself guilty of wickedness in her
treatment of him.&nbsp; An instinct toward abstract justice, rare
in women, uplifted her in this strait; the stricken man clung to
her mind and would not be banished.&nbsp; Even before
Timothy&rsquo;s subsequent abasement and self-accusations, she
could not forget the past or live even for an hour in the joy of
the present.&nbsp; The very note of triumph in her loved
one&rsquo;s voice jarred upon her.&nbsp; It was, therefore, with
feelings painfully mingled and heart distracted by many doubts
that Sarah met John Aggett at last.</p>
<p>He was harsh enough&mdash;harsh to brutality&mdash;and for
some subtle reason this attitude moved her to the <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>step he least
expected.&nbsp; Softness and kind speech might have sent Sarah
weeping to Timothy after all; but the ferocity, despair and
distraction of the big flaxen man confirmed her in a contrary
course of action.&nbsp; She put her hands into his, cried out
that, before God, she was his woman for all time, and that his
woman she would remain until the end.&nbsp; John Aggett strangled
his reason upon this loving declaration&mdash;as many a stronger
spirit would have done.&nbsp; He told himself that his gigantic
love might well serve for them both; he caressed the wanderer in
love and called upon Heaven to hear his thanksgivings.&nbsp; New
rosy-fledged hope sprang and soared in his heart at this unhoped
blessing, and for a few blissful days light returned to his face,
elasticity to his step.&nbsp; He had steeled his soul to part
with her; he had told himself the worst of the agony was over,
but in reality the girl had come back into his life again before
the real grief of his loss had bitten itself into his mind.&nbsp;
Now, despite the inner whisper that told him his joy rested on
the most futile foundations possible, he took her back as he had
resigned her&mdash;in a whirlwind of emotion.&nbsp; And he
assured himself that, having once yielded her up, neither men nor
God could reasonably ask him to do so again.</p>
<p>Mrs. Belworthy it was who first penetrated the false pretence
and mockery of the new understanding.&nbsp; Upon the strength of
that discovery she <a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>communicated in secret with Timothy Chave, and bade him
cultivate patience and be of good cheer despite the darkness of
appearances.&nbsp; Sarah, indeed, shewed by no sign that she
desired to turn from her bargain again; but the emptiness and
aridity of these renewed relations could not be hidden.&nbsp;
Even John grasped the truth after a fortnight of hollow
lovemaking.&nbsp; He tried to reawaken the old romance, to
galvanise a new interest into the old hopes and plans; but
Sarah&rsquo;s simulation too often broke down despite her best
endeavours.&nbsp; Tears filled her eyes even while she clung most
fiercely to him; her parents murmured their regrets that John
should persist in ruining her life.&nbsp; Indeed, Mrs. Belworthy
did more than murmur; she took an occasion to speak strongly to
the cowman; yet he shut his eyes to the truth and blundered
blindly on, straining every nerve and racking his brain to
discover means whereby Sarah might be won back to the old simple
ways, to her former humility of ambition and simplicity of
thought.&nbsp; But any restoration of the past conditions was
impossible, for her mind had much expanded in Timothy&rsquo;s
keeping; and this fact did Aggett, by slow and bitter stages, at
length receive and accept.&nbsp; With heart the sorer for his
temporary flicker of renewed happiness, he tore himself from out
a fool&rsquo;s paradise and abandoned hope and Sarah once for
all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis vain to make believe any more,&rdquo; he
said to <a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>her.&nbsp; &ldquo;God knows you&rsquo;ve tried your
hardest, but you ban&rsquo;t built to throw dust in a
body&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; Your bread&rsquo;s a-been leavened
wi&rsquo; tears these many days, an&rsquo; your heart&rsquo;s in
arms against the falling out of things.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis natural
as it should be so.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve tried to come together
again an&rsquo; failed.&nbsp; Us can do no more now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave &rsquo;e I won&rsquo;t; if you beat me away from
&rsquo;e like a dog, like a dog I&rsquo;ll come back
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave me you must, Sally.&nbsp; I ban&rsquo;t gwaine to
spoil your butivul life for all time wi&rsquo; my love, though
you come wi&rsquo; open arms an&rsquo; ax me to.&nbsp; Go to un
free, an&rsquo; take my solemn word as I&rsquo;ll rage against
him no more.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll know you&rsquo;m happy then;
an&rsquo; that must be my happiness.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll never
forget you comed twice to me o&rsquo; your own free
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;m a gude man&mdash;a gert saintly
man&mdash;an&rsquo; God knows why I be so pitiful weak that
anything born should have come between us, once I&rsquo;d
promised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many things comes between the bee an&rsquo; the butt,
the cup an&rsquo; the lip, men an&rsquo; women folks an&rsquo;
their hopes o&rsquo; happiness.&nbsp; Please God you&rsquo;ll
fare happy wi&rsquo; him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deserve it, if theer&rsquo;s any justice
in the sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Theer ban&rsquo;t to my knowledge.&nbsp; Pray God
He&rsquo;ll be gude to &rsquo;e&mdash;then I&rsquo;ll forgive the
man.&nbsp; An&rsquo; the <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>world won&rsquo;t come to me for his
character whether or no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She protested and wept; he was firm.&nbsp; For a little hour
his lofty mood held and he completed the final act of
renunciation before he slept.&nbsp; Knowing full well that Chave
would never hear the truth from Sarah, he laid wait for him that
night and met him in Postbridge at a late hour.</p>
<p>The men stood side by side in the empty, naked road that here
crossed Dart by a pack-saddle bridge.&nbsp; The night was rough
and cold but dry, and the wind wailing through naked beeches, the
river rattling harshly over its granite bed, chimed in unison
with the recent sorrow of Timothy&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; When Sarah
announced her determination, the youth had threatened
self-destruction and foretold madness.&nbsp; Neither one thing
nor the other happened, but he was sufficiently miserable and his
sufferings had by no means grown blunted on this night as he
plodded wearily through the village.</p>
<p>Aggett, moving out of the darkness, recognised his man and
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come you here&mdash;on to the bridge,&rdquo; he said
abruptly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Theer us&rsquo;ll be out o&rsquo; the way
o&rsquo; the world, an&rsquo; can sit &rsquo;pon the stones
an&rsquo; I can say what&rsquo;s to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing to talk about between us.&nbsp; If you
knew how much I have suffered and am still suffering, you&rsquo;d
spare me more words.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>&ldquo;Aw jimmery!&nbsp; You&rsquo;m a poor
whinin&rsquo; twoad&mdash;too slack-twisted for any full-grown
woman, I should have reckoned.&nbsp; But your luck be in.&nbsp;
She comed back to me for duty; now she&rsquo;m gwaine back to you
for love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she know her own mind, John?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ess fay, an&rsquo; allus did arter you come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Aggett briefly explained the events of the past fortnight
and his own determination concerning Sarah, while the younger man
felt his blood wake from its sleep and race again through his
veins.&nbsp; His treasure had not been lost and life was worth
living yet.&nbsp; He had tact sufficient to make no comments upon
the story.&nbsp; He spared John Aggett many words.&nbsp; But he
gazed once or twice at the other&rsquo;s heaving breast and wild
eyes and told himself that the cowman was a being altogether
beyond his power to understand.&nbsp; Then he crept away as
quickly as he could and did not sleep until he had spoken with
Sarah.&nbsp; On this occasion his account of events was framed in
words of most meek and humble sort.&nbsp; He awarded Aggett full
measure of praise, while upon himself he heaped sufficient
obloquy, feeling that he could very well afford to do so as a
price for this return to paradise.</p>
<h3><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>CHAPTER VII</h3>
<p>Now thundered upon John Aggett the full flood of his griefs at
highest water-mark.&nbsp; Until this time hopes had alternated
with fears, possibilities of recovered joy with the thought of
utter loss.&nbsp; Then he had possessed Sarah&rsquo;s promises
and the consciousness that in his hands, not another&rsquo;s, lay
the future.&nbsp; But now John had departed out of her life for
good and all, and the great act of self-renunciation was
complete.&nbsp; To the highest-minded and noblest soul something
in the nature of anti-climax must have followed upon this
action.&nbsp; That one capable of so great a deed and such
unselfish love possessed ample reserves of self-command and
self-control to live his life henceforward on the same high plane
by no means followed.&nbsp; Having by his own act insured the
highest good for the woman he loved, John Aggett&rsquo;s
subsequent display sank far below that standard and indeed
embraced a rule of life inferior to his usual conduct.&nbsp; A
supreme unconcern as to what might now await him characterised
his actions.&nbsp; As a lighthouse lamp illuminates some horror
of sea and stone, so his notable deed shone in a sorry <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>setting, for
John Aggett&rsquo;s existence now sank as much below its usual
level of indifferent goodness as his relinquishment of Sarah
Belworthy, for love of her, had risen above it.&nbsp; Until the
present his attachment to the girl and hope of happiness had made
him a hard-working man, and since his engagement he had laboured
with the patience of a beast and counted weariness a delight as
the shillings in his savings-box increased.&nbsp; Now incentive
to further work was withdrawn, he abated his energies, lacking
wit to realise that upon sustained toil and ceaseless mental
occupation his salvation might depend.&nbsp; His final departure
from Bellever Barton was brought about as the result of a curious
interview with his master.</p>
<p>To Farmer Chave, young Timothy, now reestablished with Sarah,
had come to break the news of his betrothal.&nbsp; But no
parental congratulation rewarded the announcement.&nbsp; Mr.
Chave knew every man and woman in Postbridge, and was familiar
with the fact that the blacksmith&rsquo;s daughter had long been
engaged to his cowman.&nbsp; That his son and heir should favour
a labourer&rsquo;s sweetheart was a galling discovery and
provoked language of a sort seldom heard even in those
plain-speaking times.&nbsp; Finally the father dismissed his son,
bade him get out of sight and conquer his calf-love once and for
all or hold himself disinherited.&nbsp; A little later he acted
on <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>his own
shrewd judgement and held converse with Sarah&rsquo;s original
suitor.</p>
<p>John was milking as the farmer entered his cow-yard, and a
flood of sunlight slanted over the low byre roofs and made the
coats of the cattle shine ripe chestnut red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evenin&rsquo; to &rsquo;e, Aggett.&nbsp; Leave that job
an&rsquo; come an&rsquo; have a tell wi&rsquo; me.&nbsp; I wants
to speak to &rsquo;e.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evenin&rsquo;, maister.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll milk
`Prim&rsquo; dry, &rsquo;cause she do awnly give down to
me.&nbsp; Milly can do t&rsquo;others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farmer Chave waited until the cow &ldquo;Prim&rdquo; had
yielded her store, then he led the way to an empty
cow-stall&mdash;dark, cool and scented by its inhabitants.&nbsp;
Across the threshold fell a bar of light; without, a vast heap of
rich ordure sent forth delicate sun-tinted vapour; close at hand
the cows stood waiting each her turn, and one with greatly
distended udder lowed to the milkmaid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look you here, Jan Aggett, you&rsquo;m for
marryin&rsquo;, ban&rsquo;t &rsquo;e?&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t you tell
me when I took you on as a you was keepin&rsquo; company
wi&rsquo; blacksmith&rsquo;s purty darter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas so, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m one as likes to see my hands married
an&rsquo; settled an&rsquo; getting childer &rsquo;cordin&rsquo;
to Bible command.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s your wages this
minute?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;m on a wrong tack, maister.&nbsp; Sarah <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>Belworthy
an&rsquo; me be out.&nbsp; Theer&rsquo;s nought betwixt us
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Chave affected great indignation at this statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Struth!&nbsp; Be you that sort?&rdquo;</p>
<p>John reflected a moment before answering.&nbsp; He suspected
his master must know the truth, but could not feel certain, for
Mr. Chave&rsquo;s manner suggested absolute ignorance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Us changed our minds&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say so!&nbsp; When a girl changes her mind
theer&rsquo;s generally another string to her bow.&nbsp; Either
that, or she&rsquo;s tired of waiting for the fust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be &rsquo;twas so,&rdquo; said John, falling
into the trap laid for him.&nbsp; &ldquo;A maid like her
can&rsquo;t be expected in reason to bide till such as me can
make a home for her.&nbsp; I doan&rsquo;t blame her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if that&rsquo;s the trouble, you can go right
along to her this night an&rsquo; tell her theer&rsquo;s no cause
to keep single after Eastertide.&nbsp; Yeo and his wife do leave
my cottage in Longley Bottom come then, an&rsquo; instead of
raisin&rsquo; your wages as I meant to do bimebye, I&rsquo;ll
give &rsquo;e the cot rent free.&nbsp; A tidy li&rsquo;l place
tu, I warn &rsquo;e, wi&rsquo; best part of an acre o&rsquo;
ground, an&rsquo; only half a mile from the village.&nbsp; Now be
off with &rsquo;e an&rsquo; tell the girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aggett gasped and his eyes dimmed a moment before the splendid
vision of what might have been.&nbsp; <a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>It took him long to find words and
breath to utter them.&nbsp; Then he endeavoured to explain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;m a kind maister, God knows, an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;d thank &rsquo;e year in an&rsquo; year out wi&rsquo; the
sweat o&rsquo; my body for such gudeness.&nbsp; But the thing
can&rsquo;t be, worse luck.&nbsp; Best I tell &rsquo;e
straight.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis like this: Sally have met another
chap&mdash;a chap built o&rsquo; softer mud than what I be.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; he&rsquo;m more to her than me,
an&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God A&rsquo;mighty!&nbsp; An&rsquo; you stand theer
whining wi&rsquo; no more spirit than a auld woman what&rsquo;s
lost her shoe-string!&nbsp; A chap hath kindiddled the maid from
&rsquo;e?&nbsp; Another man hath stole her?&nbsp; Is that what
you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>John grew fiery red, breathed hard and rubbed his chin with a
huge fist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ban&rsquo;t the man I cares a curse for.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis the girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rubbishy auld nonsense!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis woman&rsquo;s
play to show &rsquo;e the worth of her.&nbsp; They&rsquo;m built
that way an&rsquo; think no man can value &rsquo;em right unless
he sees they&rsquo;m for other markets so well as his.&nbsp; Do
&rsquo;e know what that vixen wants &rsquo;e to do?&nbsp; Why,
she&rsquo;s awnly waiting for &rsquo;e to give t&rsquo;other chap
a damn gude hiding!&nbsp; Then she&rsquo;ll cuddle round
again&mdash;like a cat arter fish.&nbsp; I know
&rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>John&rsquo;s jaw dropped before this sensational advice.&nbsp;
Now he was more than ever convinced that his master knew nothing
of the truth.&nbsp; It appeared to him <a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>the most fantastic irony that a
father should thus in ignorance condemn his son to such a
sentence.&nbsp; Then Aggett put a question that shewed quickening
of perception.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If &rsquo;twas your own flesh an&rsquo; blood, what
would &rsquo;e say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same as I be sayin&rsquo; now.&nbsp; Burned if
I&rsquo;d blame any man for sticking to his own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It be your son,&rdquo; declared John, shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; answered the other.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here.&nbsp; You&rsquo;m not the
fule you look, Jan, an&rsquo; you know so well as I can tell
&rsquo;e this match ban&rsquo;t seemly nohow.&nbsp; I ban&rsquo;t
agwaine to have it&mdash;not if the Lard Bishop axed me.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; I tell you plain an&rsquo; plump&mdash;me being your
master&mdash;that you must stop it.&nbsp; The girl&rsquo;s your
girl, an&rsquo; you must keep her to her bargain.&nbsp; An&rsquo;
you won&rsquo;t repent it neither.&nbsp; Marry her out of hand
an&rsquo; look to me for the rest.&nbsp; An&rsquo; if a
word&rsquo;s said, send him as sez it to me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
soon shut their mouths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ban&rsquo;t the folks&mdash;&rsquo;tis her.&nbsp; She
do love your son wi&rsquo; all her heart an&rsquo;
soul&mdash;an&rsquo; he loves her&mdash;onless he&rsquo;s a
liar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drivel!&nbsp; What does he know about love&mdash;a
moon-blind calf like him?&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t have it, I tell
&rsquo;e.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s gone his awn way to long!&nbsp;
Spoiled by his fule of a mother from the church-vamp<a

bit of folly.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not to be&mdash;dost hear what I
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear.&nbsp; Go your ways, maister, an&rsquo; prevent
it if you can.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not meddle or make in the
matter.&nbsp; Sally Belworthy have chosen, an&rsquo; ban&rsquo;t
me as can force her to change her mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More fule her.&nbsp; An&rsquo; between the pair of

in a nutshell.&nbsp; Will &rsquo;e take the cottage an&rsquo;
make her marry you?&nbsp; I lay you could if you was
masterful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never&mdash;ban&rsquo;t a fair thing to ax a
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best hear me through &rsquo;fore you sez it.&nbsp; If
you&rsquo;m against me in this, you can go to hell for all I
care.&nbsp; If you won&rsquo;t help me to keep my son from
disgracing me an&rsquo; mine, you&rsquo;m no true man, an&rsquo;
I doan&rsquo;t want &rsquo;e any more to Bellever Farm.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis a wife an&rsquo; a home rent free &rsquo;pon wan side,
an&rsquo; the sack on the other.&nbsp; So you&rsquo;d best to
make choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go Saturday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all the ninnyhammers ever I saw!&nbsp; You gert
yellow-headed cake, can&rsquo;t you see you&rsquo;m
spoilin&rsquo; your awn life?&nbsp; Or was it that t&rsquo;other
side offered &rsquo;e better terms?&nbsp; If that&rsquo;s so, you
won&rsquo;t get &rsquo;em, because Tim Chave&rsquo;ll be a pauper
man the day he marries wi&rsquo;out my leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The farmer stormed awhile longer, but presently he stamped off
and Aggett returned to his mother.&nbsp; Then, as he had angered
Mr. Chave, so did his own <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>parent enrage him.&nbsp; She
protested at his folly, and implored him to carry out his
master&rsquo;s wish while opportunity remained to do so.&nbsp; He
was strong against it until the old woman went on her knees to
him and wept.&nbsp; Then he lost his temper and cursed the whole
earth and all thereon for a cruel tangle that passed the
understanding of man to unravel.</p>
<p>Later in the evening he revisited the village and before ten
o&rsquo;clock returned intoxicated to his home.</p>
<h3><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>CHAPTER VIII</h3>
<p>From that day forward John Aggett exhibited a spectacle of
reckless indifference to circumstances and a manner of life
lightened only by occasional returns to sobriety and
self-command.&nbsp; As to how it fared with Timothy and Sarah he
cared not.&nbsp; Others ceased to speak of the matter in his
presence, and thus it happened that he went in ignorance of
events for the space of five weeks.&nbsp; During that period he
loafed at the &ldquo;Green Man&rdquo; Inn until his money was
spent, then returned to dwell with his mother.</p>
<p>Meantime Timothy Chave&rsquo;s romance was prospering ill,
despite his rival&rsquo;s endeavour to make the way easy.&nbsp;
Other obstacles now confronted him, and though Sarah was happy
and well content to live in the delight of each hour with her
lover, Tim found delay less easily borne and struggled to change
Mr. Chave&rsquo;s attitude toward his desires.&nbsp; But it
proved useless, and the young man chafed in vain.&nbsp; He
assured Sarah that his father was merely an obstinate elder and
would surely be won to reason in good time; but the full
significance of her engagement with Timothy, as his father viewed
it, she did <a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>not know and never would have heard from Tim&rsquo;s
lips.&nbsp; There happened, however, an accidental meeting
between Sarah and Farmer Chave himself, and this brushed all
mystery or doubt from the girl&rsquo;s mind, opened her eyes to
the gravity of Tim&rsquo;s actions and left her face to face with
the truth.</p>
<p>One day Sarah, on foot, with her face set homeward, observed
Farmer Chave riding back from Widecombe to Postbridge on a big
bay horse.&nbsp; He saw her, too, eyed her narrowly and slackened
speed, while she wished the road might open and swallow her from
his sight.&nbsp; But there was no escape, so she curtseyed and
wished Mr. Chave a very good evening.&nbsp; He returned the
salute and seeing, as he believed, a possibility of setting all
right on the spot by one great master-stroke, attempted the
same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my girl, Belworthy&rsquo;s darter, ban&rsquo;t
&rsquo;e?&nbsp; A peart maid an&rsquo; well thought on, I doubt
not.&nbsp; Be you gwaine home-along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sarah&rsquo;s heart fluttered at this genial salutation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ess, maister,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll lighten your journey.&nbsp; I
haven&rsquo;t got the double saddle, but you&rsquo;m awnly a
featherweight an&rsquo; can ride pillion behind me an&rsquo; save
your shoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mode of travel he suggested was common enough in those
days, but such a proposal from Tim&rsquo;s father frightened
Sarah not a little.&nbsp; Her first thought was for herself, her
second for her <a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>sweetheart, and she nerved herself to refuse the
farmer&rsquo;s offer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;m very kind, sir,
but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No &lsquo;buts.&rsquo;&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a stone will
make a splendid upping stock, an&rsquo; `Sharky&rsquo; can carry
the pair of us without knowing his load be increased.&nbsp; Up
you get!&nbsp; Theer&rsquo;s plenty of room for my fardels in
front o&rsquo; the pommel.&nbsp; Us won&rsquo;t bate our pace for
you, I promise.&nbsp; Now jump!&nbsp; Whoa, bwoy!&nbsp; Theer we
are.&nbsp; Just put your arms around my flannel waistcoat
an&rsquo; doan&rsquo;t be shy.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis well I met
&rsquo;e, come to think on&rsquo;t, for I wanted a matter
o&rsquo; few words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon they jogged forward, the big horse taking little account
of Sarah&rsquo;s extra weight.&nbsp; At length they crossed
Riddon Ridge and passed Dart at a ford, where Sarah had to hold
up her toes out of the reach of the river.&nbsp; Then, as they
rode along the foothills of Bellever, the farmer spoke
suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My life&rsquo;s been wisht of late days along wi&rsquo;
taking thought for my son Tim.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve heard tell of
un?&nbsp; You see, &rsquo;tis my wish to have un mated wi&rsquo;
his cousin.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m led to onderstand as
theer&rsquo;s a maiden up-long he thinks he likes better;
an&rsquo; her name&rsquo;s same as yours, Sarah
Belworthy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Maister Chave, I do love un very dear, I
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you done to that yellow man, Jan Aggett.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tweern&rsquo;t the same.&nbsp; When Maister
Timothy comed, I seed differ&rsquo;nt.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>&ldquo;Doan&rsquo;t shake an&rsquo; tremble.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll never have no reason to fear me.&nbsp; Tell me how
&rsquo;twas.&nbsp; Jan gived &rsquo;e up&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ess, he did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For love of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Now that was a brave fashion deed.&nbsp; I
allus thought a lot of the man, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m sorry
you&rsquo;ve sent un to the Devil, wheer they tell me he&rsquo;s
bound of late days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;m a gude man, an&rsquo; I wish to God as
something could be done to bring him back in the right
road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ess fay!&nbsp; An&rsquo; you&rsquo;m the one as would
have to look the shortest distance to find a way to do it,
Sarah.&nbsp; A gude example that man, for all his foolishness
since.&nbsp; Loved &rsquo;e well enough to leave
&rsquo;e&mdash;for your own gude, he did&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless him for doin&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why doan&rsquo;t &rsquo;e go back to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot, I cannot now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, man&rsquo;s love be greater than woman&rsquo;s by
the look of it.&nbsp; What girl would have done same as that man
done?&nbsp; What girl would give up a man for love of him,
an&rsquo; even leave un for his gude?&nbsp; Not one as ever I
heard tell of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many an&rsquo; many would for that matter.&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s a sacrifice if your love be big enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>&ldquo;Be yours?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the question
I&rsquo;d ax &rsquo;e.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sarah&rsquo;s heart sank low; Mr. Chave felt her shiver and
the hands clasped over his thick waistcoat tremble.&nbsp; Looking
down, he saw her fingers peeping out of woollen mittens; and upon
one, sacred to the ring, a small gold hoop appeared with a coral
bead set therein.</p>
<p>Sarah did not answer the last pointed question, and Farmer
Chave continued:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;ve promised to be wife to my son some
day, an&rsquo; I know he&rsquo;ve taken partickler gude care to
hide from you my view of the question.&nbsp; But you must hear
it, for your awn sake as well as his an&rsquo; mine.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve nothin&rsquo; against you, Sarah, nothin&rsquo;,
an&rsquo; less than nothin&rsquo;, for I like you well an&rsquo;
wish to see you so gude as you&rsquo;m purty an&rsquo; so happy
as you&rsquo;m gude; but I know my son for a lad of light
purposes an&rsquo; weak will an&rsquo; wrong ambitions.&nbsp;
Ban&rsquo;t enough iron in un; an&rsquo; the maid I&rsquo;m set
on for un have got a plenty backbone to make up for his
lack.&nbsp; Her he&rsquo;s to wed in fulness o&rsquo; time, if
I&rsquo;ve any voice left in affairs; an&rsquo; if he
doan&rsquo;t, &rsquo;tis gude-bye to Bellever for him, an&rsquo;
gude-bye to more&rsquo;n that.&nbsp; So theer he stands, Sarah,
an&rsquo; you&rsquo;d best to hear what it means.&nbsp; Maybe you
thought you was makin&rsquo; choice between a labourin&rsquo; man
an&rsquo; a gentleman, between a pauper an&rsquo; a young chap
wi&rsquo; his pockets full o&rsquo; money.&nbsp; But ban&rsquo;t
so, I assure &rsquo;e.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the gentleman&rsquo;ll be
the <a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>pauper
if he marries you; but John Aggett&mdash;why, I offered un my
cottage in Longley Bottom free o&rsquo; rent from the day as your
banns was axed in marriage wi&rsquo; un to Widecombe
Church!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the man as gived &rsquo;e up for love
of &rsquo;e.&nbsp; An&rsquo; ban&rsquo;t you so strong as
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tu gude he was&mdash;tu gude for the likes o&rsquo;
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as to t&rsquo;other, though he&rsquo;s my son,
blamed if I think he&rsquo;s gude enough.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s
neither here nor theer.&nbsp; The question ban&rsquo;t what sort
of love he&rsquo;s got for you; but what sort you&rsquo;ve got
for him.&nbsp; Do &rsquo;e follow my meanin&rsquo;?&nbsp; I
doan&rsquo;t storm or rave, you see&mdash;tu wise for that.&nbsp;
I only bid you think serious whether your feeling for
Timothy&rsquo;s the sort to ruin him, or to save him from
ruin.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a hard choice for &rsquo;e, but we&rsquo;m
all faaced wi&rsquo; ugly puzzles &rsquo;pon the crossways
o&rsquo; life.&nbsp; Now you know my &rsquo;pinions, you&rsquo;ll
do what&rsquo;s right, or you&rsquo;m not the girl I think
&rsquo;e.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must give un up for all time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best not put it that way.&nbsp; Doan&rsquo;t drag my
rascal of a bwoy in the argeyment.&nbsp; Say to yourself,
&lsquo;I must mate him as I promised to mate&mdash;him
that&rsquo;s wastin&rsquo; his life an&rsquo; gwaine all wrong
for love o&rsquo; me.&rsquo;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis plain duty, woman,
looked at right.&nbsp; Not that I&rsquo;d rob &rsquo;e of the
pleasure of knowin&rsquo; you&rsquo;d done a gert deed if you
gived Tim up; but t&rsquo;other&rsquo;s the man as you&rsquo;ve
got to think of; an&rsquo;, if you do <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>this gude thing, &rsquo;tis just
similar as he done for you.&nbsp; Wi&rsquo; Jan Aggett be your
happiness wrapped up, if you could see it.&nbsp; An&rsquo;
Jan&rsquo;s much more like to go well in marriage harness than my
son be, or I doan&rsquo;t know carater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try, I&rsquo;ll try.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s more
than I&rsquo;ve heart or strength for, but I&rsquo;ll try,
Maister Chave.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll try to do right by both of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who could say fairer?&nbsp; An&rsquo; here&rsquo;s the
lane to blacksmith&rsquo;s, so I&rsquo;ll drop &rsquo;e.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; give your faither my respects an&rsquo; tell un I want
un to-morrow to the farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Sarah had dismounted the farmer spoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take to heart what I&rsquo;ve said to &rsquo;e,
an&rsquo; remember that to please me won&rsquo;t be a bad action
from a worldly side.&nbsp; Go back to Jan Aggett, Sarah
Belworthy; that&rsquo;s my advice to you, an&rsquo; angels from
heaven couldn&rsquo;t give &rsquo;e no better, &rsquo;cause theer
ban&rsquo;t room for two &rsquo;pinions.&nbsp; Now let me hear
what metal you&rsquo;m made of, an&rsquo; that afore the week be
out.&nbsp; So gude night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man trotted off with knees stiff and elbows at right
angles to his body; the girl entered her home; and that night,
tossing and turning wearily, thrice she decided to give up her
lover and thrice determined to take no definite step until she
had again seen and spoken with Timothy.&nbsp; But her heart told
her that such a course was of all the <a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>weakest.&nbsp; Presently she assured
herself that many plans might be pursued and that wide choice of
action lay before her.&nbsp; Then John Aggett chiefly occupied
her thoughts.&nbsp; To go back to him now appeared absolutely
impossible.&nbsp; He had given her up, at a cost even she but
dimly guessed, and to return into his troubled life again struck
her as a deed beyond measure difficult and dangerous.</p>
<p>Long she reflected miserably on the sorrow of her lot; then,
in the small hours of morning and upon the threshold of sleep,
Sarah determined to let another judge of her right course of
conduct and dictate it to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas the white witch, Gammer Gurney, as foretold
Tim would marry me that terrible night,&rdquo; she thought.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then &rsquo;tis for she to say what I should do an&rsquo;
what I shouldn&rsquo;t do.&nbsp; If &rsquo;tis ordained by higher
things than men-folk as I&rsquo;m to have Tim, what&rsquo;s the
use o&rsquo; weeping &rsquo;cause Farmer Chave wishes
differ&rsquo;nt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a sort of comfort in this philosophy; but her grey
eyes closed upon a wet pillow as she slept, to wake with sudden
starts and twitches from visions in great aisles of gloom, from
dim knowledge of horrors hidden behind storm-clouds, from the
murmur of remote callings and threatenings and cries of woe, from
all-embracing dread begotten of a heavy heart, and an outlook
wholly dreary and desolate.</p>
<h3><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>CHAPTER IX</h3>
<p>With morning light Sarah&rsquo;s decision to visit Gammer
Gurney was still strong in her, and she determined to call upon
the white witch before another nightfall.&nbsp; It was this
enterprise that precipitated affairs and brought their end within
sight.</p>
<p>Upon the evening that saw Sarah riding pillion with Farmer
Chave, John Aggett had met the curate of Postbridge&mdash;one
Reverend Cosmo Hawkes.&nbsp; The parson, who was a keen
sportsman, came across John upon the Moor and improved his
occasion to such good purpose that Aggett&rsquo;s ears tingled
before the man of God had done with him.&nbsp; They returned
together, and on the way home Mr. Hawkes, with admirable
pertinacity, so hammered and pounded the erring labourer, that he
alarmed him into frank regret for his evil ways.&nbsp; The
reckless and unhappy young man was steadied by his
minister&rsquo;s forcible description of what most surely awaits
all evil livers; and when Mr. Hawkes, striking while the iron was
hot, undertook to get Aggett good and enduring work at Ashburton,
John promised to comply and to reform his bad courses from that
day forth.&nbsp; The decision come to, he spent his last hours of
<a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>freedom in
folly.&nbsp; That night he drank hard, and when deep measures had
loosened his tongue, explained to numerous &ldquo;Green
Man&rdquo; gossips the thing he proposed to do.&nbsp; Afterward,
when the overdose of drink in him had turned to poison, hope died
again and his mother, listening fearfully at his door, heard him
muttering and cursing and growling of death as the only friend
left to him.&nbsp; In the morning he was oppressed by the
immediate prospect of breathing the same air with Sarah Belworthy
no more.&nbsp; He alternated between savage indifference and
stubborn fatalism.&nbsp; In the first mood he was minded to
depart at once; in the second he felt disposed to seek out Tim
Chave and let the brute in him have its fling.&nbsp; He itched
for batterings in the flesh.&nbsp; But he visited Postbridge,
obtained the letter of introduction from Mr. Hawkes, and then
seriously set himself to the task of preparing for
departure.&nbsp; He told his mother that he would return within a
fortnight, and she rejoiced, feeling his temporary absence a
light evil as compared with his present life.&nbsp; But the
truth, that he was leaving home not to return, she never
suspected.&nbsp; All preliminary matters arranged, John Aggett
bade farewell, lifted his bundle and set out, after an early
dinner, for Ashburton, and as he passed Sarah Belworthy&rsquo;s
home and saw the straggling village of Postbridge sink into the
naked web of the woods, a <a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>dark inclination mastered him again
and passions that craved outlet in violence clouded down stormily
upon his soul.&nbsp; But resolutely he carried his turmoil of
thoughts along at the rate of four miles an hour, and quickly
passing beside the river southward, approached Yar Tor and the
road to Ashburton.&nbsp; Then, as there appeared the spectacle of
Gammer Gurney&rsquo;s cottage, standing in its innocent humility
and forlorn loneliness upon the Moor edge, John observed a woman
ahead of him and realised that the last familiar face his eyes
would rest upon must be Sarah Belworthy&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Guessing
her errand, he slackened his pace that she might reach the
cottage and disappear without knowledge of his presence; but as
he walked more slowly, so did Sarah, though quite unconscious of
the fact her old lover was at hand; and presently, to his
astonishment, the girl stopped altogether, hesitated, and sat
down by the wayside on a boulder.&nbsp; A determination not to
avoid her now influenced Aggett.&nbsp; He approached, and, as he
reached her and stood still, Sarah grew very pale and shewed some
fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, Jan!&nbsp; An&rsquo; settin&rsquo; forth
&rsquo;pon a journey by the look of it.&nbsp; Wheer be
gwaine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of this, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say as to that.&nbsp; I ban&rsquo;t myself
of late days&mdash;not my own man as I used to be.&nbsp; God <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>knows wheer
my changed temper&rsquo;s like to drive me in the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the same with me, Jan.&nbsp; I doan&rsquo;t
know my duty no clearer now than afore.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m torn to
pieces one way an&rsquo; another, an&rsquo; theer won&rsquo;t be
much left o&rsquo; me worth any man&rsquo;s love come
bimebye.&nbsp; Sometimes I think I&rsquo;ll run right away next
giglet-market<a name="citation84"></a><a href="#footnote84"
class="citation">[84]</a> to Okehampton, come Our Lady&rsquo;s
Day, an&rsquo; hire myself out to the fust as axes, an&rsquo;
never set eyes on this place more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ban&rsquo;t &rsquo;e happy yet, then?&nbsp; What more
do &rsquo;e want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My love&rsquo;s a curse wheer it falls.&nbsp; I loved
&rsquo;e an&rsquo; brought &rsquo;e to bad ways; an&rsquo;
Tim&mdash;I&rsquo;ve set his nearest an&rsquo; dearest against
un.&nbsp; I seed Farmer Chave essterday, an&rsquo; he urged me by
the Book to give un up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Struth!&nbsp; He said that, did he?&nbsp; But
you didn&rsquo;t fall in wi&rsquo; it, I reckon, else you
wouldn&rsquo;t be here now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis all to difficult for the likes o&rsquo;
me.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s a poor maiden to do?&nbsp; If I takes Tim,
he&rsquo;ll be a ruined man, &rsquo;cordin&rsquo; to his
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas a mean, cowardly trick to threaten
&rsquo;e.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But plain truth&mdash;I could see that.&nbsp; A
terrible tantara theer&rsquo;ll be in Bellever if he braves the
anger <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>of
Farmer.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve prayed an&rsquo; prayed&mdash;Lard He
knows how I&rsquo;ve prayed&mdash;&lsquo;pon it,
but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prayers won&rsquo;t help &rsquo;e; leastways, they
didn&rsquo;t me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve lifted up far-reachin&rsquo;
prayers in my time, I promise you, Sarah,&mdash;the best I could;
but never no answer,&mdash;never so much as a Voice in the night
to help a chap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You done right to pray an&rsquo; you was led right,
though you didn&rsquo;t know it.&nbsp; An&rsquo; you&rsquo;m well
thought of for what you&rsquo;ve done still, despite your
fallin&rsquo; away arterward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind &rsquo;bout me.&nbsp; I be gwaine far ways
off, an&rsquo; so like&rsquo;s not us&rsquo;ll never set eyes
&rsquo;pon each other more.&nbsp; For me, I&rsquo;d so soon end
all as not.&nbsp; But for mother I should have got out of it
afore now, for I ban&rsquo;t feared o&rsquo; dyin&rsquo;,
an&rsquo; would go out o&rsquo; hand this minute.&nbsp; But
you?&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t the man help &rsquo;e?&nbsp; Do he know
your fix?&nbsp; What the devil be he made of?&nbsp;
Sugar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doan&rsquo;t know yet that I&rsquo;ve spoken
wi&rsquo; his faither.&nbsp; An&rsquo; he&rsquo;ve been careful
to hide that his folks was against me.&nbsp; I s&rsquo;pose
&rsquo;tis natural they should be so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ess&mdash;not knowin&rsquo; you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; in my gert quandary I was gwaine in to Mother
Gurney here.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s juggled wi&rsquo; my life afore,
seemin&rsquo;ly, an&rsquo; if any knows what&rsquo;s to be the
end of it, &rsquo;tis her, I should think.&nbsp; I want to hear
<a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>what&rsquo;s right an&rsquo; proper.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m so
weary of my days as you.&nbsp; Life an&rsquo; love be gall-bitter
this way.&nbsp; Oh, Jan, can&rsquo;t &rsquo;e say nought to
comfort me?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis more&rsquo;n I can bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was hysterical, and he flung down his bundle and sat
beside her and tried to bring some peace to her spirit.&nbsp; His
heart was full for her and he spoke eagerly.&nbsp; Then he saw
the gold and coral on her finger and stopped talking and put his
elbows on his knees and his big sandy head down on his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas what you done, &rsquo;twas same as what you
done,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You left me for love of me;
why can&rsquo;t I leave Tim for love of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis axin&rsquo; a woman to much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A long silence reigned.&nbsp; Wind-blown ponies stamped and
snorted close at hand, and from a window in the neighbouring
cottage a sharp eye watched the man and woman.&nbsp; Gammer was
counting the chances of a customer, possibly two.</p>
<p>Fired with a glimmer of the hope that can never perish while
the maid is free, John Aggett argued the advantages of obedience
to Farmer Chave.&nbsp; He felt himself base in this, but Sarah
was under his eyes, within reach of his arm.&nbsp; Her hot tears
were on his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis for you I be thinkin&rsquo;, though you
might say &rsquo;twas two words for myself an&rsquo; but one for
you.&nbsp; <a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>I wants your sorrow turned into joy, Sally, if
it&rsquo;s a thing can be done.&nbsp; Leave me
out&mdash;theer&mdash;now I&rsquo;m not thinkin&rsquo; for myself
at all.&nbsp; Leave me out, an&rsquo; leave him out, an&rsquo;
bide a maid till the right man finds &rsquo;e.&nbsp; I lay he
haven&rsquo;t crossed your path yet.&nbsp; Give young Chave up
for your own sake, if not his, an&rsquo; look life in the face
again free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He continued fitfully in this strain, quenching his own dim
hope remorselessly as he spoke, and she, hearing little save the
drone of his voice, occupied herself with her own thoughts.&nbsp;
Her emotions toward John Aggett had never much changed.&nbsp; Her
love for Tim, being a feeling of different quality, had left her
temperate if sincere regard for John unmoved.&nbsp; Possibly his
own action in the past had rendered her more kindly disposed to
him than before.&nbsp; There certainly existed in her mind a
homespun, drab regard for him, and circumstances had not changed
it.</p>
<p>Now as he strengthened her determination to give up her lover
for her lover&rsquo;s good, and despite the bitterness of her
spirit before the sacrifice, she could find some room in her mind
for the man before her.&nbsp; To-day the presence of Sarah awoke
the finest note in John.&nbsp; His first dim hope was
extinguished; he soared above it, resolutely banished any
personal interest in the problem now to be solved, and assumed
that Sarah had similarly <a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>obliterated him from all
considerations of the future.&nbsp; But it was not so.</p>
<p>Presently the girl declared her mind to be made up and
promised that she would break off her engagement.&nbsp; For a
moment the other showed hearty satisfaction, then his forehead
grew wrinkled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing mind,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;My name
must not crop up no more in this.&nbsp; Ban&rsquo;t that I fear
anything man can do, but theer&rsquo;ll be no weight to what you
sez onless you make it clear &rsquo;tis your own thought.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis you I care about&mdash;an&rsquo; &rsquo;tis him you
care about.&nbsp; I be gude as gone a&rsquo;ready.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twas mere chance throwed us together, an&rsquo; none need
know &rsquo;bout it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was silent awhile, then put her hand out to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do owe you more&rsquo;n ever a maid owed a man, I
reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took and held the hand extended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot help what&rsquo;s past and gone.&nbsp; Just
call me home to your mind now an&rsquo; again&mdash;that&rsquo;s
all I ax &rsquo;e.&nbsp; Now I must be movin&rsquo;, for
I&rsquo;ve got long ways to go to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even in her misery she took a mournful pleasure in her power
to command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down an&rsquo; bide till I bid you go,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>He obeyed, resumed the seat from which he had risen and tied
and untied his bundle, but did not speak.</p>
<p><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>&ldquo;If us could call back a year an&rsquo; begin
livin&rsquo; all over again, Jan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked down at her, puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man would give his soul to go back a bit sometimes;
but that&rsquo;s about the awnly thing God A&rsquo;mighty&rsquo;s
self can&rsquo;t do, I reckon.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis more&rsquo;n His
power to give back essterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can do it His own way.&nbsp; He can help us poor
unhappy creatures to forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So can a pint of old ale; not but them around about a
man mostly looks to it that the raw of sorrow shan&rsquo;t heal
tu quick for want of callin&rsquo; to mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jan, I&rsquo;m gwaine to give him up.&nbsp; I have
given him up for all time.&nbsp; I shall allus love him, Jan,
because I must.&nbsp; But that is all.&nbsp; An&rsquo;
you&mdash;you mustn&rsquo;t go out into the world an&rsquo;
wander &rsquo;pon the airth an&rsquo; maybe never come home no
more through fault of mine.&nbsp; Ban&rsquo;t fair as two men
should break theer hearts an&rsquo; have theer days ruined for
one worthless woman.&nbsp; What I am, I am; what I felt for you,
Jan, I feel&mdash;no more, no less.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t I
loved you less than I always did, but him more.&nbsp; If
&rsquo;tis unmaidenly so to say, rebuke me, Jan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus she deliberately came into his life again for the third
time, and he was overwhelmed.&nbsp; And yet his answer was one of
almost savage fierceness.&nbsp; Joy shook him, too,&mdash;a sort
of incredulous joy, as when one dreams rare things, yet knows
that one dreams.&nbsp; <a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>The mingled emotions of the time
upset his self-control, induced a sort of tense excitation and
rendered his voice indistinct, hollow, mumbling as that of a man
drunken or cleft in palate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That!&nbsp; That!&nbsp; You say that to me&mdash;arter
all these long, long days!&nbsp; To come back now!&nbsp; God in
Heaven, what a puppet dance &rsquo;tis!&nbsp; Now here, now
theer&mdash;be your heart so light as thistledown?&nbsp; I
doan&rsquo;t know wheer I stand; I&rsquo;m mazed as a sheep this
minute.&nbsp; An&rsquo; you&rsquo;d come back to me
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would, Jan.&nbsp; I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; live man an&rsquo; wife to the li&rsquo;l lew
cot offered us by the gudeness of Farmer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not that.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t do that.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve a heart soft enough to understand.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
go with &rsquo;e, wheer you be gwaine&mdash;ay, this very day I
will.&nbsp; But I can&rsquo;t bide here.&nbsp; I must get away
from&mdash;from mother, an&rsquo; faither, an&rsquo; all.&nbsp;
Then us can send a packet to &rsquo;em from far off.&nbsp;
Anywheer but Postbridge, Jan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;m in honest, sober, Bible earnest,
Sarah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s my witness, I be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then He&rsquo;s my witness, tu, that I stand here a new
man&mdash;an&rsquo; not shamed o&rsquo; the crumbs from
t&rsquo;other&rsquo;s table.&nbsp; You to come back!&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis more&rsquo;n my deserts&mdash;such a drunken swine as
I&rsquo;ve been since&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused a moment, then his manner changed <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>suddenly and
he gripped the girl&rsquo;s arm so hard and glared so wildly that
Gammer Gurney from her window feared a serious quarrel and nearly
rushed out to separate them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind this, then,&rdquo; he said, with harsh
intensity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mind this, now; you&rsquo;m my whole life
again,&mdash;body, an&rsquo; bones, an&rsquo; blood, an&rsquo;
soul,&mdash;from this moment onwards.&nbsp; Theer&rsquo;s gwaine
to be no more changing now&mdash;no more altering your
mind&mdash;or, by Christ, I won&rsquo;t answer for myself.&nbsp;
I ban&rsquo;t so strong o&rsquo; will as I was, an&rsquo; since
you&rsquo;ve comed to me of your own free will, mine you&rsquo;ll
be till death ends it; an&rsquo; Lard help them as try to keep us
apart now.&nbsp; Lard help &rsquo;em an&rsquo; deliver &rsquo;em
from me.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve come, an&rsquo; I trust
&rsquo;e&mdash;trust &rsquo;e same as I trust the sun to
rise.&nbsp; But if you throw me over again,
I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&nbsp; No matter to speak on that.&nbsp; Awnly
I&rsquo;ll be true as steel to &rsquo;e; an&rsquo; you must play
your part an&rsquo; look over your shoulder no more.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve spoke out o&rsquo; your heart, me out o&rsquo; mine;
so let it be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was alarmed at this outburst, uttered with almost brutal
energy and in loud accents.&nbsp; But it served its purpose and
impressed her vacillating spirit with the impossibility of any
further changes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been up an&rsquo; down, him an&rsquo; me,
full long enough,&rdquo; continued Aggett.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now,
thanks be to a just God as I&rsquo;d nearly forgot, you&rsquo;ve
come back to me an&rsquo; I could crow like a marnin&rsquo; cock
to think <a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>it.&nbsp; An&rsquo; now what&rsquo;ll please &rsquo;e to
do?&nbsp; Will &rsquo;e come along o&rsquo; me this
minute?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ess&mdash;no&mdash;not now; but to-night I might.&nbsp;
I must go home an&rsquo; put together a few things an&rsquo; pack
up others.&nbsp; I can send along to home for my li&rsquo;l box
later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-night, then.&nbsp; An&rsquo;, come next Sunday,
us&rsquo;ll be axed out in church at Ashburton straightway.&nbsp;
Come to think, &rsquo;twould be better for you to bide along
wi&rsquo; your folk until I be ready for &rsquo;e a week or two
hence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; She was going to confess
that she could not trust herself, but feared his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why for not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stop here without you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
come.&nbsp; They can hear the truth after I have gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-night, then,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wheer shall I meet &rsquo;e to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the beech&mdash;you know.&nbsp; Through the woods be
the nearest road for us.&nbsp; To the gert beech, wheer I set our
letters in a love knot.&nbsp; No better place.&nbsp; Theer
I&rsquo;ll come, an&rsquo; theer I&rsquo;ll count to see &rsquo;e
when the moon rises over the hill.&nbsp; An&rsquo; doan&rsquo;t
&rsquo;e keep me waitin&rsquo;&mdash;not a moment, not the atom
of a moment!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve gone through enough, an&rsquo; my
brain spins yet to think o&rsquo; the past.&nbsp; Suffer more I
can&rsquo;t&mdash;no more at all.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be sorry to
your dying day if you&rsquo;m late.&nbsp; Better never come than
that.&nbsp; My head be <a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>full o&rsquo; strange things at this
wonnerful happy happening,&mdash;strange things,&mdash;but
I&rsquo;ll say no more than bid you be to the beech by moon-rise,
if &rsquo;tis true that you love me an&rsquo; not false.&nbsp; Be
theer&mdash;or you&rsquo;ll awnly repent it once, Sarah,
an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s so long as you do live arter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He exhibited little love now and less tenderness.&nbsp; It
almost appeared that a mind long familiar with darkness was
unable to accept and understand the light suddenly shed upon
it.&nbsp; A note of impending catastrophe sounded in his words,
seemed shadowed in his wild eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fright me,&rdquo; said Sarah.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
doan&rsquo;t take me as I hoped you would.&nbsp; You ban&rsquo;t
your old self, yet.&nbsp; How should you be for that
matter?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis only poor second-hand goods I&rsquo;m
bringing to &rsquo;e.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis what I had first promise
of.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be all a man can be to &rsquo;e&mdash;all I
should be.&nbsp; Forgive me for harsh words; but I be dazed
wi&rsquo; this gert come-along-o&rsquo;-it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been
sore let for many days, an&rsquo; &rsquo;twill take time to make
me see wi&rsquo; the old eyes when the brains in my head grow
sweet an&rsquo; cool again, an&rsquo; the poison works out of
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They talked a little while longer, then the white witch from
her chamber window saw them turn and together retrace their
steps.</p>
<h3><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>CHAPTER X</h3>
<p>That highest hope, long abandoned, should thus suddenly return
within his reach, staggered John Aggett, and went far to upset
the man&rsquo;s mental equilibrium.&nbsp; Indeed, it had been but
a little exaggeration to describe his mind as, for the time,
unhinged.&nbsp; The splendour of his changed position dazed
him.&nbsp; Joy and bewilderment strove for mastery, and from a
medley of poignant sensations was bred the passionate desire of
possession, and a wild hunger to secure for his own what had been
withheld so long.</p>
<p>Sarah Belworthy, for her part, experienced great turbulence of
conflicting fears.&nbsp; Her mind was fixed, yet had something in
it of absolute terror, as she reflected upon the recent
interview.&nbsp; She had offered herself to him as a sudden
inspiration; and now, retracing that fevered scene, John
Aggett&rsquo;s frenzy of demeanour alarmed her much, for it was a
revelation of the man she had not encountered until then.&nbsp;
Presently an answer came to her puzzled mind&mdash;a solution of
a sort that made the blood surge hotly to Sarah&rsquo;s
face.&nbsp; Could it be that she had offered herself where she
was wanted no more?&nbsp; <a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>Had John&rsquo;s chivalry alone been
responsible for his ready undertaking to receive her back?&nbsp;
She nearly screamed in the silence of her little chamber at this
thought; she desisted from her labour of preparation and flung
herself upon her bed in secret shame.&nbsp; But reason quickly
banished the fear.&nbsp; She remembered the man&rsquo;s
intoxication of joy, his delirious thanksgiving.&nbsp; She felt
her bosom sore where he had hugged her to himself and praised the
God of Justice.&nbsp; Next she retraced his subsequent display of
passion, his extravagant utterances and threats.&nbsp; She
realized very fully that he held the pending crisis as one of
vital magnitude and knew that he was strung to a pitch far beyond
any that previous experience of him had exhibited or revealed to
her.&nbsp; She determined to give him no cause for further
excitement and so returned to her work, wondering the while what
this ingredient of fear might be that had entered into her
emotions concerning him.</p>
<p>Anon her thoughts passed to the other man, and the last
struggle began.&nbsp; For his own salvation she was leaving him,
but with natural human weakness she much desired that he should
know of her great sacrifice in the time to come.&nbsp; That
Timothy should pursue his life in ignorance of the truth after
she had departed was a terrible thought to Sarah; but, since to
see him again appeared out of the question, there remained a
possibility that he would deem her <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>faithless and worthless to the
end.&nbsp; She knelt and prayed that the nature of the thing she
had done might be revealed to him in fulness of time; and then
her mind grew active in another direction and she marvelled why
she had thrown herself back into her first lover&rsquo;s arms and
not taken his advice to remain free of both.&nbsp; Her feelings
toward Aggett eluded all possibility of analysis or
understanding.&nbsp; She fled from them to the task of setting
her small possessions in order and packing her basket for the
forthcoming departure.</p>
<p>Sarah could not write, and she was unable therefore to leave
any message for her parents.&nbsp; Their anxiety must endure for
the space of a day and night, but might then be allayed.&nbsp;
She pictured herself dictating a letter to the scrivener at
Ashburton, and wondered what she should put in it.</p>
<p>As the time approached and the day died, the vision of Timothy
grew clearer and more clear.&nbsp; She saw his grief and
indignation, his sorrow and dismay; she knew every line in his
face which would contract, every furrow that would be deepened,
at this event; and she speculated drearily upon his course of
action and shivered at the possibility of a meeting between the
men.&nbsp; Her distraction did not obscure the drift of
John&rsquo;s last words, or blind her to the importance of
keeping tryst at the beech, for he had made it clear that some
disaster must <a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>overtake them if she delayed her coming beyond the
rising of the moon.&nbsp; It wanted twenty minutes to eight when
Sarah started to meet the partner of her future life; and as her
destination was only a short half-mile distant, she allowed ample
time to reach it.</p>
<p>Meantime Aggett had passed down the hill five minutes
sooner.&nbsp; It was a night of broken clouds.&nbsp; Rapid motion
in the direction of the zenith seemed imparted to the stars, as
scattered vapour, driven before a light northwesterly breeze,
passed across them.&nbsp; With ascending movement, the moon would
presently mount a silvery stairway of clouds and pass swimming
upward across one scattered tract of darkness to the next.&nbsp;
The nocturnal world beneath was full of soft light and sweet
spring scent.&nbsp; Nature&rsquo;s busy fingers moved about those
duties men see not in the act.&nbsp; From umbels of infant
chestnut leaves she drew the sheaths, loosed the folds of
primroses and wood anemones, opened the little olive-coloured
buds of the woodbine&rsquo;s foliage, liberated the chrysoprase
spears of the wild arums from the dry earth.&nbsp; A fern owl
whirred and wheeled about a blackthorn tree that stood alone near
Aggett&rsquo;s cottage door.&nbsp; Green leaves now clothed it,
where a few weeks earlier blossoms had made the tree snow
white.&nbsp; The spring green of field and forest and hedgerow
looked wan under the increasing light of the eastern horizon;
valleyward a <a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>mist, born of recent rain, wound sinuously and shimmered
opalescent, while above all loomed a background of night-hidden
Moor.&nbsp; Viewed at this distance the waste returned no spark
or twinkle from the sky, but extended, darkly and gigantically,
along the horizon and made the upper chambers of the air shine
out the brighter for its own dimensionless obscurity.</p>
<p>John Aggett passed from the embrace of the night wind into the
denser atmosphere of the woods beneath.&nbsp; A stream brawled
beside him and ran before the cottage of the Belworthys.&nbsp;
Here he dawdled a moment, half in hope to meet Sarah; but he felt
confident that she was in reality before him and would be waiting
ere now at the beech.&nbsp; Proceeding downward, he passed a
young man leaning against a gate.&nbsp; The youth stood quite
motionless, and over his shoulder Aggett observed widespreading
grass-lands.&nbsp; Upon the expanse of dim green, parallel bars
of faint light between equal tracts of gloom indicated that a
roller had been passed regularly over the field to better its
promise of future hay.</p>
<p>The man turned, and John, knowing the other for Timothy Chave,
guessed that he awaited a companion.&nbsp; Instant rage set his
blood racing; the veins in his neck and forehead bulged; the
muscles of hand and arm hardened, but he kept <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>in shadow and
passed upon the farther side of the road where the stream
ran.&nbsp; Timothy said &ldquo;good night&rdquo; in the voice of
one who does not recognise him to whom he speaks; but Aggett
returned no answer and, satisfied that he had not been
recognised, soon passed out of earshot.&nbsp; His mind was now
darker than the shadows of the pine trees, fuller of brooding
whispers than their inky tops; but he fought against foreboding
with the full strength of his will, set presentiment of evil
behind him, and lifted his voice and spoke aloud to cheer
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her&rsquo;ll be down-along; her&rsquo;ll surely be
down-along, dear heart, waitin&rsquo; for me.&nbsp; She knows
nought about the chap standin&rsquo; theer.&nbsp; It can&rsquo;t
be.&nbsp; She&rsquo;m strong set to follow, for &rsquo;tis the
road of her own choosin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He proceeded to the spot where Sarah had first promised
herself to him.&nbsp; The beech bole shone ghost grey; as yet no
copper-coloured bud-spike had opened and aloft the thickening
traceries, still spotted by a few seed-cases of last year&rsquo;s
mast, shewed in wonderful black lace-work against the silver
sky.&nbsp; Sarah Belworthy was not visible, and Aggett felt a
mighty dread tightening at his stomach, like hands.&nbsp; He
threw down his bundle and stick.&nbsp; Then he listened awhile,
only to hear the jolt and grind of a wood-sledge proceeding down
the hill.&nbsp; <a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>He looked about him, calculated that it yet wanted ten
minutes to moon-rise, then struck a light with a flint, puffed it
into flame and sought idly for the initials and lover&rsquo;s
knot that he had set upon the beech.&nbsp; His work had suffered
little since its first completion; but now it vanished, for, upon
some sudden whim, the man fetched out his knife, obliterated the
inscription with a few heavy gashes, pared all away, and left
nothing but a raw white blaze upon the bark.&nbsp; His own
downcast condition puzzled him.&nbsp; Now, albeit within five
minutes of his triumph, now, while each moment was surely
bringing Sarah to him on tripping feet, he grew more morose and
ill at ease.&nbsp; It was the thought of the other standing at
the gate.&nbsp; Once more John talked to himself aloud to cheer
his spirit.&nbsp; &ldquo;Curse the fule&mdash;standin&rsquo; so
stark as a mommet<a name="citation100"></a><a href="#footnote100"
class="citation">[100]</a> to fright pixies.&nbsp; Her
won&rsquo;t stop for him&mdash;never.&nbsp; Her&rsquo;ll come;
her&rsquo;s promised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He repeated the words over and over again like a parrot; but a
voice, loud as his own, answered him and mocked him out of the
darkness.&nbsp; His life and its futility reeled before him, like
phantasmagoria upon the night.&nbsp; He stamped and swore to
disturb the visions; but as he waited and listened for
Sarah&rsquo;s coming, the past took visible shape again and
summoned pictures of days gone by, when he went <a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>wool-gathering with little Sally on the Moor.&nbsp; No
sound broke the silence, no footfall gladdened his heart.&nbsp;
And then there floated out the moon over the black billows of the
horizon.&nbsp; Very slowly its silver ascended into the sky and
rained splendour upon the nocturnal earth.&nbsp; The hour of
moon-rise was numbered with time past and the world rolled
on.</p>
<p>Great floods of passion drowned the man.&nbsp; He flung
himself upon the earth and beat the young green things with his
clenched hands.&nbsp; The smell of bruised primroses touched his
nostrils and in the spirit he saw Sarah Belworthy again bearing a
great nosegay of them.&nbsp; She moved beside him through a
bygone April; her laugh made music through the spring woods; her
lips were very red; and round her girl&rsquo;s throat hung a
little necklace of hedge-sparrow&rsquo;s eggs, blue as the vernal
sky.</p>
<p>Aggett arose, rubbed the earth from his knuckles and began to
tighten the thong he wore about his waist.&nbsp; But the leather
under his hands suddenly challenged his mind, and he took off the
belt and examined it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her never loved me&mdash;never&mdash;never,&rdquo; he
said to the night.&nbsp; &ldquo;To leave me arter what I
said&mdash;to leave me now knowin&rsquo;&mdash;&rsquo;Tis
enough.&nbsp; I be tired&mdash;I be weary of the whole
earth.&nbsp; Her lied to me through it all; but I won&rsquo;t lie
to she.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He flung down the belt, then picked it up again <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>and removed
a little bag that was fastened to it and contained a few
shillings in silver.&nbsp; This he placed beside his
bundle.&nbsp; Then he flung the long snaky coil of the girdle
upon the ground and stood staring at it.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Sarah, hastening down the hill five minutes after
John had noted Timothy at the gate of the hayfield, similarly saw
and recognised him.&nbsp; His presence reminded her of a fact
entirely forgotten during the recent storm and stress.&nbsp; He
was there by appointment and eager to hear the first rustle of
his sweetheart&rsquo;s approach.&nbsp; Now her heart flogged at
her breast and she felt her knees weaken.&nbsp; But she kept
steadily on with averted face and instinct quick to find
concealment in every shadow.&nbsp; She drew her hood about her
and walked upon the grass by the wayside.</p>
<p>The man heard and turned, waking from a reverie.&nbsp; He saw
his sweetheart even as she passed him by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sally!&nbsp; It is Sally!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>She did not answer, though his voice shook her to the
well-springs of her life; and he, supposing that she was about
some lover&rsquo;s pretty folly, laughed joyously and came after
her.&nbsp; Then she hastened the more, and he did likewise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A starlight chase!&nbsp; So be it, sweetheart; but
you&rsquo;ll have to pay a heavy penalty when I catch
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>Still
she could not speak; then, perceiving that he must speedily
overtake her, she found her tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Christ&rsquo;s sake, doan&rsquo;t &rsquo;e follow
me!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis life&mdash;life an&rsquo; death.&nbsp;
Ban&rsquo;t no time for play.&nbsp; Turn back, Tim, turn back if
you ever loved me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her tone alarmed him and he hesitated a moment, then came
steadily on again, calling to Sarah to stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me what&rsquo;s amiss&mdash;quick&mdash;quick,
dear one!&nbsp; Who should help you in the whole world but your
Tim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now her quick brains had devised a means of possible
escape.&nbsp; The stream that ran by the road here passed
immediately under a high hazel hedge, and the bank had been torn
down by cattle at one point.&nbsp; Upon the other side of this
gap extended a narrow meadow at the fringe of young coppice
woods.&nbsp; Once within this shelter Sarah felt she might be
safe.&nbsp; But there was not a moment to lose, for Tim had now
approached within fifteen yards of her.&nbsp; A thousand thoughts
hastened through the girl&rsquo;s mind in those fleeting moments,
and not the least was one of indignation against her
pursuer.&nbsp; She had bid him stay in the name of Christ, yet he
paid no heed, but blundered on, dead to consequences, ignorant of
the awful evil for which he might be responsible if he restrained
her.&nbsp; To leap the stream was Sarah&rsquo;s first
task&mdash;a feat <a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>trifling by day, but not so easy now that night had
sucked detail from the scene and banished every particular of the
brook&rsquo;s rough course.&nbsp; Here its waters chattered
invisible; here they dipped under young grasses and
forget-me-nots; here twinkled out only to vanish again, engulfed
by great shadows.&nbsp; The girl sped upon her uneven way, marked
the gap ahead and in her haste, mistaking for light a grey stone
immediately before her at a little bend in the stream, leapt
forward, struck her feet against granite, and, falling, spread
her hands to save herself.&nbsp; But, despite this action, her
forehead came violently against the stone and her left foot
suffered still more severely.&nbsp; She struggled to recover and
rise, while her basket tumbled into the stream, scattering small,
precious possessions on the water.&nbsp; With a desperate effort
Sarah actually regained her feet, but only to lose consciousness
and be caught up in Tim Chave&rsquo;s arms as she fell again.</p>
<p>Then it was her pursuer&rsquo;s turn to suffer; though rapid
action relieved him of some anxiety and occupied his mind.&nbsp;
The place was very lonely, the girl apparently dead.&nbsp; For
half an hour he sought to revive her; then she opened her eyes
and lifted them to the moon; and by slow stages of broken
thoughts took up the thread of her life again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God&mdash;thank God, my darling!&nbsp; If you
only knew what I have endured!&nbsp; I thought you <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>had killed
yourself and the terror of it has made me grow old.&nbsp; What,
in Heaven&rsquo;s name, were you doing to run from me like
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put up one hand to her head and uttered a shivering sigh,
but as yet lacked the power to speak.&nbsp; Beneath her hair was
a terrible bruise, and she felt that something stabbed her eyes
and made them flash red fiery rings into the cold silver of the
moonlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;just one little word, my
treasure&mdash;just one word, so that I may know my life has come
back to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she spoke, slowly at first, with increased speed as her
memory regained clearness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;no.&nbsp; Not to Tim&mdash;not back
to Tim.&nbsp; I remember.&nbsp; I fell running away from
&rsquo;e.&nbsp; You sinned a gert sin to come arter me when I
bade &rsquo;e in Christ&rsquo;s name to let me abide.&nbsp; Help
me now&mdash;now &rsquo;fore &rsquo;tis to late.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
the least you can do an&rsquo; theer&rsquo;s a man&rsquo;s life
hanging to it for all I know.&nbsp; Say nothin&rsquo;; ax
nothin&rsquo;; help me&mdash;help me quick to go to
un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To whom, Sarah?&nbsp; You&rsquo;re dreaming,
lovey.&nbsp; Who should I take you to&mdash;your father?&nbsp;
But I&rsquo;m here&mdash;Timothy&mdash;an&rsquo; thank God I
was.&nbsp; What frightened you so?&nbsp; Like a moonbeam you went
and nearly broke your neck and my heart together&mdash;&lsquo;pon
my honour you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>&ldquo;Help me,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give over
talkin&rsquo;, for it ban&rsquo;t the time.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll
know how &rsquo;twas some day.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve prayed solemn as
you should know.&nbsp; Let me go down-along
quick&mdash;quicker&rsquo;n lightning&mdash;or it may be too
late.&nbsp; Wheer&rsquo;s my basket gone?&nbsp; I had a
li&rsquo;l basket.&nbsp; An&rsquo; allus b&rsquo;lieve I loved
&rsquo;e&mdash;b&rsquo;lieve it to the end of the
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if I ever doubted it!&nbsp; Now let me carry you
right home, my little wounded bird.&nbsp; The sooner the
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I tell &rsquo;e.&nbsp; Help me to my feet&mdash;now
this instant minute, if you doan&rsquo;t want me to go mad!&nbsp;
Theer&rsquo;s things hid&mdash;terrible things!&nbsp; I must
go.&nbsp; He won&rsquo;t wait for me; he swore it.&nbsp; Down to
the gert beech he bides&mdash;Jan&mdash;Jan Aggett!&nbsp; Oh,
help me, my own love; help me, Tim, for my body&rsquo;s weak
an&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t rise up without &rsquo;e.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To him&mdash;help you to him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean it.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t tell you
nothin&rsquo;.&nbsp; For the love of the Lard, doan&rsquo;t talk
no more.&nbsp; Oh, if I thwart un!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She struggled desperately, like a trapped animal that sees dog
or man approaching; and he helped her to stand, though now he
scarcely knew what he did.&nbsp; Then the pang of a dislocated
bone in her foot pierced the girl and she cried aloud and sank
back breathless and faint with pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go to un, so you must.&nbsp; Hasten,
hasten, <a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>if ever you loved me, an&rsquo; mend the gert wrong
you&rsquo;ve done by bringing me to this.&nbsp; Speed down to the
beech at the corner o&rsquo; the woods an&rsquo; tell Jan Aggett
what have fallen out.&nbsp; Never mind me; my foot ban&rsquo;t no
account; but Jan&mdash;him&mdash;tell un I&rsquo;m here against
my will.&nbsp; Shout aloud through the peace o&rsquo; the night
as you&rsquo;m coming to un from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still he hesitated until her voice rose in a high-pitched
shriek of impatience and she tore her hair and beat her
breast.&nbsp; Then he departed and even ran as she screamed to
him to go faster.</p>
<p>Once fairly started, Timothy made the best of his way to
Postbridge for a doctor and man&rsquo;s aid to carry Sarah to her
home.&nbsp; At the dripping well beside the stile he stopped a
moment and shouted his rival&rsquo;s name till the woods echoed;
but no answer came and he ran on, gasping, to the village.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later Timothy returned to the hill with a
medical man and two labourers.&nbsp; Investigation proved that
Sarah Belworthy had not been very gravely injured, though her
mind was evidently suffering from some serious shock.&nbsp; She
asked for Aggett on Tim&rsquo;s return and, being assured that he
had left the beech tree before her messenger reached it, she
relapsed into silence.&nbsp; Soon the slight dislocation in her
foot was reduced and she lay in comfort on the pallet that she
had thought to press no more.</p>
<h3><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>CHAPTER XI</h3>
<p>A small boy, playing truant from his dame&rsquo;s school,
discovered the nature of John Aggett&rsquo;s final action.&nbsp;
The lad, seeking for those elements of mystery and adventure
never absent from a wood, found both readily enough, where a
great beech stood at the precincts of the pine forest.&nbsp;
First a bundle in a red handkerchief with a stout stick lying
beside it made the explorer peep fearfully about for the
owner.&nbsp; Then he found him; and the small boy&rsquo;s eyes
grew round, his hair rose under his cap and his jaw fell.&nbsp;
Lifted but a few inches above his head, and hanging by the neck
from a great limb of the beech, was a man weary of waiting for a
woman who could not keep her word.</p>
<p>In the earth they laid John Aggett, at the junction of
cross-roads not far from his mother&rsquo;s home; and they
handled his clay roughly and, cutting a blackthorn stake from the
tree by his cottage door, buried the man with old-time
indignities and set no mark upon his grave.</p>
<p>For two years Sarah and Timothy were strangers after that
night; then Farmer Chave passed to his ancestors and Tim found
himself lord of Bellever <a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>Barton and a free man.&nbsp; In
course of time he won the girl back&mdash;indeed little effort
was needed to do so.&nbsp; Their wedded life is not recorded and
may be supposed to have passed peacefully away.&nbsp; A
son&rsquo;s son now reigns in the place of his yeoman fathers;
and his grandparents lie together under the grass of Widecombe
churchyard.&nbsp; There, for fifty years an antique monument has
risen above them, and a fat cherub puffed at a posthorn; but
to-day gold lichens threaten to obliterate the manifold virtues
of Timothy Chave and his lady as set forth on slanting stone.</p>
<p>And the other man rests lonely under the sloe tree; for its
green wood grew and flourished to the amazement of those who set
it there.&nbsp; Yet the purple harvest of that haggard and
time-fretted thorn men still bid their children leave upon the
bough; for the roots of it wind in the dust of the unholy dead,
and to gather the flower or pluck the fruit would be to beckon
sorrow.</p>
<h2><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>&lsquo;CORBAN&rsquo;</h2>
<p><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a question which to drown,&rdquo;
said Mr. Sage.</p>
<p>He smoked his churchwarden and looked down between his knees
where a mother cat was gazing up at him with green eyes.&nbsp;
She purred, rolled half on her back and opened and contracted her
forepaws with pleasure, while she suckled two kittens.</p>
<p>Mr. Sage&rsquo;s daughter&mdash;a maiden of
twelve&mdash;begged him to spare both squeaking dabs of life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;m so like as two peas, faither&mdash;braave
li&rsquo;l chets both.&nbsp; Doan&rsquo;t &rsquo;e drown wan of
&rsquo;em,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thicky cat&rsquo;s been very generous of chets in her
time,&rdquo; declared Mr. Sage.&nbsp; &ldquo;If such things had
ghostesses, you might see a whole regiment of
&rsquo;em&mdash;black an&rsquo; white, tabby an&rsquo;
tortoiseshell&mdash;down-along by the river come dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even I shouldn&rsquo;t be feared of a chet&rsquo;s
ghostie,&rdquo; declared little Milly Sage.</p>
<p>But she had her way.&nbsp; One kitten, when it could face the
world alone, was given to a friend who dwelt some miles distant
at Princetown; the other grew into a noble tom of bold tabby
design and genial disposition.&nbsp; His mother, feeling him to
be <a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>her
masterpiece, passed gently out of life soon after her son reached
cat&rsquo;s estate.&nbsp; She had done her duty to the feline
community, and Milly mourned for her a whole week.&nbsp; But Mr.
Sage did not mourn.&nbsp; He much preferred the young tom, and
between the cat and the old man, as years passed by, there waxed
a friendship of remarkable character.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I call un &lsquo;Corban,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Mr. Sage,
&ldquo;&rsquo;cause he was a gift&mdash;a gift from my little
girl when she was a little &rsquo;un.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas her own
ram cat, you mind, but as the creature growed up, it took that
tender to me that Milly said as it must be mine; an&rsquo; mine
&rsquo;tis; an&rsquo; what he&rsquo;d do wi&rsquo;out me, or what
I&rsquo;d do wi&rsquo;out he, be blessed if I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke to his next-door neighbour and personal crony, Amos
Oldreive, a gamekeeper and river-watcher for many years.&nbsp;
Now this man was honourably retired, with a small pension and a
great rheumatism, the reward of many a damp night on behalf of
the salmon in Dart&rsquo;s ancient stream.</p>
<p>At Postbridge these old people dwelt&mdash;a hamlet in the
heart of Dartmoor&mdash;a cluster of straggling cots beside the
name-river of that region, where its eastern branch comes
tumbling through the shaggy fens beneath Cut Hill.&nbsp; Here an
elderly, disused, packhorse bridge crosses Dart, but the main
road spans its stream upon a modern arch <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>hard
by.&nbsp; The lives of Sage and Oldreive had passed within twenty
miles of this spot.&nbsp; The keeper knew every tor of the waste,
together with the phases of the seasons, and the natural history
of each bird and beast and fish sacred to sporting.&nbsp; His
friend&rsquo;s days were also spent in this desolate region, and
both ancients, when necessity or occasion drove them into towns,
felt the houses pressing upon their eyes and crushing their
foreheads and the air choking them.&nbsp; At such times they did
their business with all speed, and so returned in thankfulness to
the beech-tree grove, the cottages and those meadowlands of
Postbridge by Dart, all circled and cradled in the hills.</p>
<p>Noah Sage and his next-door neighbour quarrelled thrice daily,
and once daily made up their differences over a glass of spirit
and water, sometimes consumed in one cottage, sometimes in the
other.&nbsp; Their conditions were very similar.&nbsp; Noah had
an only daughter; Amos, an only son; and each old man, though
both had married late in life, was a widower.</p>
<p>The lad and lass, thus thrown together, came naturally to
courtship, and it was a matter understood and accepted that they
should marry when young Ted Oldreive could show a pound a
week.&nbsp; The course of true love progressed
uneventfully.&nbsp; Milly was plain, if good health, good temper
and <a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>happy, honest eyes can be plain; while Ted, a
sand-coloured and steady youth of a humble nature, leaning
naturally upon distinction of classes for his peace of mind, had
not a rival or an enemy in the world.&nbsp; Mr. Sage held him a
promising husband for Milly, and Ted&rsquo;s master, appreciating
the man&rsquo;s steadfast qualities, gave promise of the desired
number of shillings weekly when Ted should have laboured for
another six months at the Vitifer tin mines near his home.</p>
<p>Little of a sort to set down concerning these admirable folks
had arisen but for the circumstance of the cat
&lsquo;Corban.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yet, when that beast had reached the
ripe age of eight years and was still a thing of beauty and a cat
of mark at Postbridge, he sowed the seeds of strife, wrecked two
homes, and threatened seriously to interfere with the foundation
of a third.</p>
<p>It happened thus: gaffer Oldreive, by reason of increasing
infirmities, found it necessary to abandon those tramps on the
high Moor that he loved, and to occupy his time and energies
nearer home.&nbsp; Therefore he started the rearing of young
pheasants upon half an acre of land pertaining to his lease-hold
cottage.&nbsp; The old man built his own coops and bred his own
hens, as he proudly declared.&nbsp; Good money was to be made by
one who knew how to solve the difficulties of the business, and
with greatly revived <a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>interest in life, Amos bought
pheasants&rsquo; eggs and henceforth spent his time among his
coops and foster mothers.&nbsp; The occupation rendered him
egotistical, and his friend secretly regretted it; nor would he
do likewise when urged to make a similar experiment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doan&rsquo;t want no birds my side the wall,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a brave pig or two as&rsquo;ll
goody into near so much money as your pheysants; an&rsquo;
theer&rsquo;s &lsquo;Corban,&rsquo; he&rsquo;d make short work of
any such things as chicks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oldreive nodded over the party wall and glanced, not without
suspicion, at &lsquo;Corban,&rsquo; who chanced to be
present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em taste game an&rsquo; it grows &rsquo;pon
&rsquo;em like drink &rsquo;pon a human,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Corban&rsquo; stretched his thighs, cleaned his claws
on a block of firewood, and feigned indifference.&nbsp; As a
matter of fact, this big tabby tom knew all about the young
pheasants; and Mr. Oldreive knew that he knew.</p>
<p>Sage, on the other hand, with an experience of the beast
extending from infancy, through green youth to ripe prime, took
it upon him to say that this cat was trustworthy, high-minded and
actuated by motives he had never seen equalled for loftiness,
even in a dog.</p>
<p>The old keeper snorted from his side of the wall.</p>
<p><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>&ldquo;A dog!&nbsp; You wouldn&rsquo;t compare thicky,
green-eyed snake wi&rsquo; a dog, would &rsquo;e?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not me,&rdquo; answered the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;No dog
ever I knawed was worthy to wash his face for un.&nbsp; An&rsquo;
he&rsquo;m no more a green-eyed snake than your spaniel, though a
good deal more of a gen&rsquo;leman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Us won&rsquo;t argue it then, for I never knawed any
use for cats myself but to plant at the root of a
fruit-bearin&rsquo; tree,&rdquo; said Mr. Oldreive,
cynically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; I never seed no use for dogs, &rsquo;cept to
keep gen&rsquo;lefolks out of mischief,&rdquo; answered Sage, who
was a radical and no sportsman.&nbsp; He puffed, and grew a
little red as he spoke.</p>
<p>Here, and thus, arose a cloud no bigger than a man&rsquo;s
hand.&nbsp; Noah Sage stumped indoors to his daughter, while
&lsquo;Corban&rsquo; followed with pensive step and a general air
as though one should say, &ldquo;I forgive, but I can&rsquo;t
forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three days later Mr. Oldreive looked over the wall, and his
neighbour saw him, and put a hasty foot on some feathers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marnin&rsquo;, Sage.&nbsp; Look here&mdash;what I wants
to knaw be, whether your blasted cat have took wan o&rsquo; my
phaysants, or whether he haven&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might have, might not, Amos.&nbsp; Better ax un.&nbsp;
Here he be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Green-eyed innocence marked the fat round face of
&lsquo;Corban.&rsquo;&nbsp; He leapt upon the wall and saluted <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>the breeder
of pheasants with open-hearted friendship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What be onder your heel, neighbour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;a bit of rabbit&rsquo;s flax &rsquo;twas, I
think.&nbsp; My sight ban&rsquo;t so good as of old
nowadays.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rabbit&rsquo;s flax!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a
phaysant&rsquo;s feathers!&nbsp; Get away, you hookem-snivey
Judas, or I&rsquo;ll hit &rsquo;e over the chops!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This last threat concerned &lsquo;Corban,&rsquo; who was
rubbing his whiskers against Mr. Oldreive&rsquo;s waistcoat.</p>
<p>The ancient Sage puffed out his cheeks and grew as red as a
rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ban&rsquo;t the way to speak to any respectable,
well-thought-upon domestic animal, an&rsquo; you knaw it,
Amos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Domestic!&rdquo; echoed Mr. Oldreive, bitterly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;About so domestic as a auld red fox I sent off wi&rsquo; a
flea in his ear two nights since.&nbsp; Domestic!&nbsp; He
pretends to be to gain his private ends.&nbsp; Just a savage,
cruel, awnself <a name="citation119"></a><a href="#footnote119"
class="citation">[119]</a> beast of prey, an&rsquo; no
better.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t shutt foxes, &rsquo;cause they&rsquo;m
the backbone of England; but I can shutt cats
an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop theer!&rdquo; roared the other ancient.&nbsp; He
trembled with passion; his under jaw chattered; he lifted his
legs up and down and cracked the joints of his fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think I&rsquo;ve knawed &rsquo;e all these years
an&rsquo; never <a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>seed through to the devilish nature of &rsquo;e!&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis sporting as makes men all the same&mdash;no
better&rsquo;n heathen savages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other kept calm before this shattering criticism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether or no, I doan&rsquo;t breed these here
phaysants for fun, nor yet for your cat&rsquo;s
eatin&rsquo;.&nbsp; No call to quarrel, I should hope.&nbsp; But
keep un his own side the wall if you please, else he&rsquo;s like
to have an onrestful time.&nbsp; I give &rsquo;e fair
warning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;d wish for me to chain un
up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might be better&mdash;for him if you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doan&rsquo;t want you in my house to-night,&rdquo;
said the owner of &lsquo;Corban&rsquo; suddenly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve shook me.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve shook a
friendship of more&rsquo;n fifty year standing, Amos Oldreive,
an&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t abear to look upon your face again
to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More shame to you, Noah Sage!&nbsp; If you reckon your
mangy cat be more to you than a gude Christian neighbour, say
so.&nbsp; But I ban&rsquo;t gwaine to fall down an&rsquo; worship
thicky varmint&mdash;no, not for twenty men, so now you
knaw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much for friendship then,&rdquo; answered Noah Sage,
wagging his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much for a silly auld fool,&rdquo; replied Amos
Oldreive, rather rudely; and they left it at that, and each
turned his back upon his neighbour.</p>
<p>Not a word was exchanged between them for three days; then the
keeper sent in a message by <a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>Milly, who trembled before her
parent as she delivered it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Oldreive sez that &lsquo;Corban&rsquo; have killed
two more of his li&rsquo;l game-birds, faither.&nbsp; An&rsquo;
he sez that if so be as he goes for to catch puss in theer again,
he&rsquo;ll shutt un!&nbsp; Doan&rsquo;t &rsquo;e look so
grievous gallied, dear faither!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure he never
could do it after bein&rsquo; your friend fifty year, though
certainly he was cleanin&rsquo; his gun when he spoke to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shutt the cat!&nbsp; If he do, the world shall ring
with it, God&rsquo;s my judge!&nbsp; Shutt my
cat&mdash;red-handed, blood-sucking ruffian!&nbsp; Shutt my cat;
an&rsquo; then think to marry his ginger-headed son to my
darter!&nbsp; Never! the bald pelican.&nbsp; You tell him that if
a hair o&rsquo; my cat be singed by his beastly fowling-piece,
I&rsquo;ll blaze it from here to Moretonhampstead&mdash;ess fay,
I will, an&rsquo; lock him up, an&rsquo; you shan&rsquo;t marry
his Ted neither.&nbsp; Shutt my&mdash;Lord! to think as that man
have been trusted by me for half a century!&nbsp; I cream all
down my spine to picture his black heart.&nbsp; Guy Fawkes be a
Christian gen&rsquo;leman to un.&nbsp; Here!
&lsquo;Corban&rsquo;!&nbsp; &lsquo;Corban&rsquo;!&nbsp;
&lsquo;Corban&rsquo;!&nbsp; Wheer be you to, cat?&nbsp; Come
here, caan&rsquo;t &rsquo;e, my purty auld dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stormed off, and Milly, her small eyes grown troubled and
her lips drawn down somewhat, hastened to tell Ted Oldreive the
nature of this dreadful discourse.</p>
<p><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>&ldquo;He took it very unkid,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Caan&rsquo;t deny as poor faither was strung up to a high
pitch by it.&nbsp; Such obstinate, saucy auld sillies as both
be.&nbsp; An&rsquo; if faither&rsquo;s cat do come to harm, worse
will follow, for he swears I shan&rsquo;t have &rsquo;e if Mr.
Oldreive does anything short an&rsquo; sharp wi&rsquo;
&lsquo;Corban.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted scratched his sandy locks as a way to let in light upon
slow brains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis very ill-convenient as your cat will eat
faither&rsquo;s game-birds,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but
knawin&rsquo; the store your auld man sets by the gert
hulkin&rsquo; tabby, I&rsquo;m sure my auld man never would
ackshually go for to shutt un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he does, &rsquo;tis all off betwixt you an&rsquo;
me&mdash;gospel truth.&nbsp; Faither&rsquo;s a man as stands to
his word through thunder,&rdquo; declared Milly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;An&rsquo; I ban&rsquo;t of age yet, so he can keep me from
you, an&rsquo; he will if Mr. Oldreive kills
&lsquo;Corban.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tu late for that,&rdquo; answered Ted, very
positively.&nbsp; &ldquo;The banns was up last Sunday, as your
faither well knaws.&nbsp; An&rsquo; who be he to stand against an
anointed clergyman in the house of the Lard?&nbsp; Us was axed
out to Princetown for the first time last Sunday; an&rsquo; I get
my pound a week after midsummer, as I&rsquo;ve told your
faither.&nbsp; Then us&rsquo;ll take that cottage &rsquo;pon top
of Merripit Hill, an&rsquo; auld men must fight theer awn
battles, an&rsquo; us shall be out o&rsquo; earshot, thank
God.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>&ldquo;Us be meeting trouble halfway, I hope,&rdquo;
she answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll keep a eye
&rsquo;pon &lsquo;Corban&rsquo; day an&rsquo; night so far as I
can; but you knaw what a cat is.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve got theer
own ideas an&rsquo; theer own affairs to look arter.&nbsp; Why,
if you set p&rsquo;liceman &rsquo;pon &rsquo;em, they&rsquo;d
only laugh at un.&nbsp; &lsquo;Corban&rsquo;s&rsquo; a cat as be
that independent in his ways.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll brook no
meddlin&rsquo; with&mdash;&rsquo;specially of a night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well caution un, for he&rsquo;ve got a
&rsquo;mazin&rsquo; deal of sense.&nbsp; I hope he won&rsquo;t be
overbold for his skin&rsquo;s sake, &rsquo;cause my
faither&rsquo;s every bit so much a man of his word as Mr. Sage;
an&rsquo; what he says he&rsquo;ll stick to.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ve
had to shutt a gude few score o&rsquo; cats in his business;
an&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll add your tabby to the reckoning, sure as
Judgement, if any more of his phaysants be stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus, with common gloom of mind, the lovers separated and the
clouds thickened around them.&nbsp; Their parents were no longer
upon speaking terms, and tragedy hung heavy on the air.&nbsp;
Then, in the deep and dewy silence of a June night, with Dart
murmuring under the moon and the new-born foliage of the beech
trees whispering their silky song, there burst upon the nocturnal
peace vile uproar of gunpowder.&nbsp; Somebody had fired a gun,
and the noise of it woke a thousand echoes and leapt with
reverberations thrice repeated along the stone crowns of Hartland
and Stannon and huge Broad Down.</p>
<p><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>Gaffer Sage rushed to his window, but could see nothing
more than a puff of white smoke rising lazily under the
moon.&nbsp; Trembling with dark misgivings, he crept back to bed,
but slept no more.&nbsp; &lsquo;Corban&rsquo; usually came to the
old man&rsquo;s chamber at dawn, when Milly opened the house; but
though she was stirring before five o&rsquo;clock on the
following morning, no &lsquo;Corban&rsquo; bolted into the
cottage when she unbarred the door; no familiar friend padded and
purred &ldquo;Good morning&rdquo; to Mr. Sage; neither did
&lsquo;Corban&rsquo; appear at breakfast&mdash;a course very
unusual with him.</p>
<p>Noah could not eat his meal for anxiety.&nbsp; He pushed away
his tea, rose and walked into the garden.&nbsp; Upon the other
side of the wall Amos Oldreive was casting grain to his young
pheasants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my cat to?&rdquo; asked Noah Sage,
bluntly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I heard your gun explode last night.&nbsp;
Did you shutt un?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve a right to knaw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Oldreive was clearly nervous and ill at ease, his sallow
face needing wiping before he replied.&nbsp; But his eyes shone
defiance; he pointed at the pheasants ere he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A month ago there was four dozen of &rsquo;em,&rdquo;
he said; &ldquo;now theer be ezacally three dozen an&rsquo;
two.&nbsp; An&rsquo; as for your cat, maybe I have shutt un,
an&rsquo; maybe I have not, so now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to be stringed up for it, you grizzly, <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>auld,
crook-back coward!&nbsp; I knaw very well you done it; an&rsquo;
you&rsquo;ll awnly be sorry once, and that&rsquo;s for
ever.&nbsp; Doan&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;ve heard the last of
this.&nbsp; But I must take thought afore I gets upsides with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned, went into the house and spoke to Milly.&nbsp; The
man had aged strangely in five minutes, his voice grew squeaky
and unsteady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ve&mdash;he&rsquo;ve shutt un.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;ve shutt my cat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Mr. Sage took his stick an&rsquo; walked out upon the
Moor to reflect and to consider what his life would be without
his treasure.&nbsp; He wept a little, for he was not a man of
strong intellect.&nbsp; Then his painful tears were scorched up,
and he breathed threatenings and slaughter.</p>
<p>He tramped back to Postbridge with a mind made up, and bawled
his determination over the party-wall at Amos Oldreive&rsquo;s
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your son shan&rsquo;t have my darter now&mdash;not if
he travels on his naked knees from here to Exeter for her.&nbsp;
No darter of mine shall marry the child of a dirty
murderer!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what you be; an&rsquo; all men shall
knaw it; an&rsquo; I pray God your birds&rsquo;ll get the pip to
the last one among &rsquo;em, an&rsquo; come they grows, I pray
God they&rsquo;ll choke the man as eats &rsquo;em; an&rsquo; if I
weern&rsquo;t so auld an&rsquo; so weak in the loins, be gormed
if I wouldn&rsquo;t come over the wall <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>this minute
an&rsquo; wring your skinny neck, you cruel, unlawful
beast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Oldreive looked round and cast one glance at a spot ten
yards&rsquo; distant, where the black earth looked as though
newly upturned, near an apple tree.&nbsp; But he said not a word,
only spat on his hands and proceeded with his digging.</p>
<p>A dreadful week passed, and Mr. Sage&rsquo;s mingled emotions
and misfortunes resulted in an attack of gout.&nbsp; He remained
singularly silent under this trial, but once broke into activity
and his usual vigour of speech when his old friend sent him a
dozen good trout from Dart, and a hope that his neighbour would
let bygones be bygones.&nbsp; These excellent fish, despite his
foot, Mr. Sage flung one by one through his bedroom window into
Amos Oldreive&rsquo;s front garden; for what were trout to him
with no &lsquo;Corban&rsquo; to share them?</p>
<p>Behind the scenes of this tragedy Ted and Milly dwelt dismally
on their own future.&nbsp; He clung to it that if the banns could
but be asked a third time without interference, Mr. Sage was
powerless; Milly, however, believed that she knew better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be only eighteen,&rdquo; she explained,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; faither&rsquo;s my guardian to do as he will
with me until I come of age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they were troubled in secret until a sudden and amazing
solution to the great problem came within <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>a week of
&lsquo;Corban&rsquo;s&rsquo; exit.&nbsp; The only apparent way to
be Ted&rsquo;s wife was opened through lying, and Milly rose to
the necessary heights of untruth without a pang.&nbsp; She felt
that good must come of her evil conduct&mdash;good not only to
herself, but to her unhappy father.&nbsp; His bereavement had
cost him dear.&nbsp; He still preserved a great, tragical
silence, but from time to time hinted of far-reaching deeds when
his foot should be strong enough to bear him up.</p>
<p>There came a day when Milly walked to Princetown, and,
entering into the house of certain friends there, rubbed her eyes
and stood astounded and open-mouthed before the spectacle of
&lsquo;Corban.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was no feline apparition that she
saw, but a live cat, with bold tabby markings of alternate
rabbit-brown and black&mdash;a cat with strong, flat nose, cold
and healthy; four good, well-defined tiers of whisker on either
side of his countenance; green eyes, that twinkled like the twin
lamps of a little train when seen by night, and a tail of just
proportion and brave carriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lard save us!&rdquo; cried Milly; &ldquo;however did
&rsquo;e come by this here cat, Mrs. Veale?&nbsp; I had Mr.
Oldreive&rsquo;s own sacred word as he&rsquo;d shutt un dead
an&rsquo; buried un onder his apple tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s our butivul puss; an&rsquo; you should
knaw how us come by it if anybody do, my dear, for you <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>bringed it
here in a basket from Postbridge when you was a li&rsquo;l maid
six year agone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Milly&rsquo;s active mind was working too rapidly to allow of
any reply for some moments.&nbsp; Then she told Mrs. Veale of the
recent tribulation at home, and in ten minutes an obvious plot
was hatched between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a peace-loving cat, an&rsquo; if you butter
its paws an&rsquo; treat it a bit generous in the matter of food,
&rsquo;twill very likely settle down along with you.&nbsp; Of
course, you shall have un for such a Christian purpose as to
bring them two dear auld men together again.&nbsp; An&rsquo; the
more cheese you can spare un, the more like he is to bide with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Mrs. Veale; and Milly answered:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Corban&rsquo; was fond o&rsquo; cheese, tu,
an&rsquo; his mother afore him!&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas a family
failing, no doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She scanned the cat narrowly and it mistook her attention for
admiration, and purred in a soft, guttural, elderly way, and bent
itself into a bow against her knee and showed much natural
goodness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So like t&rsquo;other as two peas!&rdquo; declared
Milly, not remembering that she had made exactly the same remark
when this cat and its late brother were born.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Faither&rsquo;s sight ban&rsquo;t strong enough to part
&rsquo;em if awnly this one behaves well,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>It was decided that the girl should come early on Sunday
morning for her tabby peacemaker, and <a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>meantime Mr. Oldreive and his son
were to be acquainted with the plot.&nbsp; As for Amos, he was an
easy man, and had not slain his neighbour&rsquo;s poaching cat
excepting under grave provocation.&nbsp; Ever since the deed he
had regretted it, but he had never confessed to the actual crime
excepting in the ears of Milly and Ted.&nbsp; Nobody had
officially announced the death of his cat to Mr. Sage.&nbsp;
Therefore, Milly hoped he would accept the stranger as his own,
and suffer peace to return amongst them.&nbsp; The Oldreives,
much cowed by Noah&rsquo;s attitude and frightened by his
illness, gladly promised to do all they might for his daughter,
and when Sunday came, she started for Princetown after an early
breakfast and left her father behind her.&nbsp; He was in better
health again, and she noticed, as an unusual circumstance, that
he appeared very full of his own affairs upon that morning, and
clearly desired her room more than her company.</p>
<p>With a heavy basket she set off homeward by nine
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Inside the wickerwork a new
&lsquo;Corban,&rsquo; after protesting once or twice at the
narrowness of its quarters, curled round nose to tail, abandoned
itself to the freaks of chance and digested an ample
breakfast.</p>
<p>But midway between Princetown and Postbridge, where the road
traversed the high Moor and stretched like a white thread between
granite hills <a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>and glimmering marsh-lands, from whence the breeding
plover called, Milly nearly dropped her basket.&nbsp; For along
the way, in a borrowed market-cart behind his own brown pony,
came her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, where on airth be you drivin&rsquo; to, my auld
dear?&rdquo; she asked; and Mr. Sage, puffing and growing very
red, made answer:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be gwaine up-long to Princetown to holy
worship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now this was an action absolutely unparalleled.&nbsp;
&ldquo;To church!&nbsp; What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you must knaw, &rsquo;tis that I may forbid your
banns wi&rsquo; Ted Oldreive.&nbsp; No use to fret nor cry.&nbsp;
I be firm as a rock &rsquo;pon it; an&rsquo; I be gwaine to deny
them banns afore the face of the Lord an&rsquo; the
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why ever should &rsquo;e do such a cruel thing, dear
faither?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because no blood o&rsquo; mine be gwaine to mix
wi&rsquo; that murdering villain&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never told you he shot
&lsquo;Corban.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;you doubt it?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t the whole of
Dartmoor know it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me get up in the cart an&rsquo; sit beside
you,&rdquo; said Milly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want for you to look in
this here basket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She leapt from the step to the driving-seat beside her father;
then opened the basket.&nbsp; Grateful for <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>this sudden
light and air, her burden gazed out, yawned, showed perfect
teeth, black lips, and a pink mouth; then jumping boldly on to
Mr. Sage&rsquo;s scanty lap, rubbed against him and purred
deeply, while its upright tail brushed his chin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s goodness!&rdquo; cried the old man, and
nearly fell out into the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody must have took un to Princetown,&rdquo; said
Milly, outwardly calm though her heart beat hard.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Theer I found un none the worse, poor twoad.&nbsp; Now
he&rsquo;s twice &lsquo;Corban,&rsquo; dear faither, an&rsquo;
twice my gift to &rsquo;e.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man was entirely deceived, as anybody even of keen
sight might well have been.&nbsp; The curious friendship of the
cat also aided his delusion.&nbsp; He stroked it, and it stood up
and put its front paws upon his necktie and rubbed noses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glory be!&nbsp; Now us&rsquo;ll go home-along,&rdquo;
said Mr. Sage.</p>
<p>His dim eyes were dimmer for tears; but he could not take them
off the creature.&nbsp; His hands also held it close.&nbsp; Milly
picked up the reins and turned the brown pony homeward, much to
his surprise and joy.</p>
<p>And &lsquo;Corban&rsquo; II., as though &rsquo;specially
directed by Providence, played its part nobly, and maintained the
imposition.&nbsp; Mr. Sage begged Amos Oldreive&rsquo;s pardon,
and Amos, for his part, calmed his <a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>conscience by assuring Noah that
henceforth his cat was more than welcome to a young pheasant
whenever it had a mind to one.&nbsp; A little strangeness on the
part of the returned wanderer seemed natural in Mr. Sage&rsquo;s
opinion.&nbsp; That he had apparently developed one or two new
habits was also reasonable in a cat with as much new experience
of the world.&nbsp; And meantime the wedding preparations were
pushed on.</p>
<p>At the end of the week Ted Oldreive came home from Vitifer for
Sunday; and he expressed joy at the sight of
&lsquo;Corban,&rsquo; once more the glory of his old haunts.</p>
<p>But the young man&rsquo;s face changed when Noah and the cat
had departed in company, and a look of frank alarm made Milly
tremble before danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s amiss, sweetheart?&rdquo; she asked,
nervously.&nbsp; &ldquo;All danger be past now, an&rsquo; the
creature&rsquo;s settled down as homely an&rsquo; pleasant as
need be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matter enough,&rdquo; said Ted; &ldquo;&rsquo;tis a ewe
cat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A ewe cat!&nbsp; Oh, Ted, doan&rsquo;t say
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis so; an&rsquo; God send her doan&rsquo;t have
chets &rsquo;fore we&rsquo;m married, else Postbridge won&rsquo;t
hold your dear faither&mdash;nor Dartymoor neither.&rdquo;</p>

<h3><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>CHAPTER I</h3>
<p>Nearly two hundred years ago, when Miser Merle departed from
life, his little corner of earth took heart and breathed
again.&nbsp; Not that he had raised any very mighty mound of gold
to stand between himself and the sunshine, but, according to his
power, he had followed the traditional road of those similarly
cursed, and though the circumstances of his life, as innkeeper of
a small hostelry at Two Bridges by Dart on the Devon moors, made
any huge accumulation impossible, none the less he was a right
miser in grain, and died without a tear to balance his two
thousand pounds of money.&nbsp; Some heartily cursed him on his
unknown way; not one pretended to mourn his passing.</p>
<p>His wife was long dead&mdash;starved with cold on a winter
night, so certain gossips loved to tell; his son the miser had
driven out of England, and subsequent rumours of the young
man&rsquo;s death troubled him not at all.</p>
<p><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>So it
came about that, when the &ldquo;Ring o&rsquo; Bells&rdquo; was
masterless, an obscure maiden, who had dwelt there since Mrs.
Merle&rsquo;s demise, found herself possessor of all the money,
for Miser Merle left no will.&nbsp; Minnie Merle was his orphaned
niece, and when the old man&rsquo;s unhappy partner shuffled off,
he bethought him of this girl.&nbsp; As a relation, lacking
friends or position, she would come without wages.&nbsp; So, from
the position of domestic servant in a Plymouth tradesman&rsquo;s
family at three pounds a year, Minnie was exalted to be the
handmaid of Miser Merle without remuneration of any kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man&rsquo;s own flesh and blood,&rdquo; he said, when
first she came, &ldquo;will understand, but I don&rsquo;t want to
poison your regard for me with money, or reduce you to the level
of a hireling.&nbsp; You are my niece; you and Nicholas Merle, in
the North Country, are all the kindred left to me now that my
wife has been taken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Minnie settled at the &ldquo;Ring o&rsquo; Bells,&rdquo;
and, being young and healthy, survived conditions that had thrust
her aunt untimely into the grave.&nbsp; The old man never trusted
his niece again after a day upon which he caught her helping two
hungry tramps to bread and cheese, because Minnie&rsquo;s idea of
a pennyworth was far more liberal than Mr. Merle&rsquo;s; but she
stayed at the inn, encouraged to the dreary necessity by local
friends, who hinted to her, behind <a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>her uncle&rsquo;s back, that such
self-denial must in the long run find itself rewarded.</p>
<p>Then the Miser, who would not put on a pair of new boots while
an old pair hung together, went through a long day wet-footed,
and so received his death-blow.&nbsp; His last conscious
utterance was a frantic petition to the medical man from
Plymouth, when that worthy told him how all hope was vain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you did ought to take half fees,&rdquo; he
gasped.&nbsp; &ldquo;As an honest man, so you did; an&rsquo;
God&rsquo;s my witness that, if you don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll never
give you no peace after I&rsquo;m took!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the physician had a material soul, feared nothing, and
held out for his bond after the patient&rsquo;s departure.&nbsp;
Minnie Merle, now a young woman of three-and-twenty, reigned at
the &ldquo;Ring o&rsquo; Bells,&rdquo; and, with sense scarcely
to have been expected from one of such youth and peculiar
experience, she did wisely as maiden hostess of the little
tavern.&nbsp; Albeit not lavish, she gave better value for money
than Mr. Merle had given; the inn grew in popularity with the
moor-men; and romance of an exciting nature hung about the place,
because many husbands were in the air for Minnie, and as yet she
had given no sign that the happy man was chosen.&nbsp; To discuss
the subject with the woman herself was not possible for men, but
Tibby Trout, an ancient gammer who cooked at the &ldquo;Ring
o&rsquo; Bells,&rdquo; enjoyed the complete <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>confidence
of her mistress, and all that Minnie desired to publish she
merely murmured into Tibby&rsquo;s ear.&nbsp; The intelligencer
had seventy years of experience behind her, and was considered
even more artful than old.</p>
<p>Tibby enjoyed to serve in the bar, as a change from the
kitchen; and at such times, when her mistress was not by, she
would discourse, mete praise and blame, waken hope here, here
chasten a mind grown too confident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be it true, Aaron French, as you told a chap to Moreton
that you knawed how the cat would jump?&rdquo; she asked, on a
night when the bar was full.</p>
<p>Aaron, a sand-coloured and a sanguine man, grew hot and
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a chap may put wan
an&rsquo; wan together without any harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No harm except to hisself.&nbsp; The wan an&rsquo; wan
you&rsquo;m putting together in your foolish head&mdash;well, her
may have named your name thoughtful-like now an&rsquo; again, but
not these many days now.&nbsp; In fact, you&rsquo;d best to say
nought about her to anybody, for you&rsquo;m awnly like to look a
fule come presently if you do.&nbsp; That man at your elbow might
explain if he would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aaron French turned upon the labourer whom Tibby indicated,
and sudden anger shook his high-pitched voice into a squeak.</p>
<p><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>&ldquo;This be your work, then, Elias Bassett,&rdquo;
he said, furiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;You to dare!&nbsp; You&mdash;the
most penniless chap &rsquo;pon Dartymoor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man addressed regarded Aaron without emotion.&nbsp;
Elias stood a head taller than his rival, was ten years younger,
and very much poorer; but he had a handsome face, a sturdy body,
and a stout right arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;m a silly poult,&rdquo; he said
contemptuously.&nbsp; &ldquo;As if a sandy-headed little monkey
like you would take any maiden onless he wanted her money.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; Mistress Merle have got two pounds for every one of
yours.&nbsp; As for me, I doan&rsquo;t care a cuss for the stuff,
and wish to God &rsquo;twas all drownded in Dart.&nbsp; All men
know that I kept company with her afore her uncle died, never
knowin&rsquo; as she was gwaine to have his ill-got money;
an&rsquo; I wish her never had got it; for then her might have
looked at me very like.&nbsp; But when it comed out her was up to
her neck in gold, so to say, I knowed it must stand between us,
and that a gamekeeper weren&rsquo;t no husband for
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seed yourself as others seed you&mdash;an&rsquo;
that&rsquo;s a very rare thing,&rdquo; said another man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, you&rsquo;re a zany for your
pains,&rdquo; declared the old woman, who had learned what she
desired to learn.&nbsp; &ldquo;You kept company with
missus&mdash;you say so.&nbsp; Then &rsquo;twas her place, not
yours, to <a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>say what was to be done after she was lifted up in the
land.&nbsp; I doan&rsquo;t mean for a moment that she&rsquo;d
look at a velveteen coat, so you needn&rsquo;t fox yourself as
you&rsquo;ve got any chance at all with her&mdash;yet her did,
careless-like, name your name to me among other chaps as
didn&rsquo;t &rsquo;pear to have learnt any manners in their
bearin&rsquo; toward women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A strong pulse stirred Elias Bassett&rsquo;s slow nature and
made him stare at the withered old woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No call to glaze like a gert bull wi&rsquo; your eyes
so round as pennies,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;An&rsquo;
what&rsquo;s more, you needn&rsquo;t take no comfort from what
I&rsquo;ve told &rsquo;e.&nbsp; I reckon her ban&rsquo;t for no
Dartymoor market.&nbsp; Wi&rsquo; her mort o&rsquo; money
an&rsquo; dearth o&rsquo; years, her can very well wait awhile
wi&rsquo;out jumping at the first clodpole among &rsquo;e as
offers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment a strange man came among them and the subject
was dropped for that time, before the interesting spectacle of a
face unfamiliar to all present.</p>
<p>The new arrival carried himself as one superior to his
company.&nbsp; He was booted and spurred, held in one hand a pair
of holsters, in the other a riding-whip.&nbsp; He gave no general
salute to those present, neither did he order refreshment, but
casting one quick glance about him, addressed himself to Gammer
Trout and asked to see the mistress of the inn.</p>
<p><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>Nicholas Merle was a big, clean-shorn man, with bright
eyes, quick movements, and the assertive manner of one accustomed
to have his way.&nbsp; There was no contempt in his attitude to
the folk assembled, but he took it for granted that he exceeded
them in importance, even as his interests rose above their own;
and not one among them questioned the assumption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Acquaint Mistress Merle that I am come&mdash;her cousin
Nicholas from Yorkshire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tibby curtseyed and went to do his bidding, while the new
arrival out-stared each man present in turn, then went to the
peat fire and kicked it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give &rsquo;e gude day,&rdquo; said Elias Bassett, in a
friendly tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;I daresay now this here lonesome auld
Moor do seem but a wisht, pixy-ridden place to a gen&rsquo;leman
like you be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very well, my good fellow&mdash;a little
contracted, that is all.&nbsp; The wolds are more spacious, but a
gentleman might make a living here if others would but let
him.&nbsp; Does anybody with a fat purse ride this
way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elias and his companions stared, and the lower jaw of Mr.
French fell until he appeared imbecile.&nbsp; Yet the
stranger&rsquo;s cynical hint brought up his listeners a little
more on to a level with him.&nbsp; Their virtue owed it to itself
to stand as high as his confessed or pretended rascality.</p>
<p><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>&ldquo;That sort of talk leads to a hemp collar,
mister,&rdquo; murmured Bassett; but Merle shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mere talk leads nowhere,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is the fashion of you clowns to take a jest in
earnest.&nbsp; But have no fear.&nbsp; I am not come among you
with any such purpose as the road.&nbsp; To-day I have ridden
from Exeter and, since leaving Moretonhampstead, saw nought but
carrion crows and a fox or two.&nbsp; This place tempts no man to
dishonesty.&nbsp; I can see upon your faces that you scarce know
the meaning of the word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gammer Tibby returned, and Merle, nodding in a friendly way to
all present, followed her through the bar to the private chambers
behind it.&nbsp; Then, hardly had the horseman clanked from
sight, when Ostler Joe Mudge appeared with his mouth full of
news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wheer be the gen&rsquo;leman to?&nbsp; Not here?&nbsp;
Then I can speak.&nbsp; Aw jimmery, what a hoss&mdash;if
&rsquo;tis a hoss!&nbsp; Never seed the like in all my
years!&nbsp; Come an&rsquo; catch sight for yourselves, sawls,
for you&rsquo;ll never believe me.&nbsp; Eyes like a human,
an&rsquo; a body all so bright as brimstone, to the last hair in
the tail of un!&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the loafers inspected a big horse of unusual colour,
Nicholas Merle introduced himself to his cousin.&nbsp; They had
never met before, and a deep interest and instant friendship
wakened in Minnie&rsquo;s breast for the only relation she
possessed in the <a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>world.&nbsp; He was a tall, resolute man of
thirty-five, with strange oaths and fatherly manner.&nbsp; He
declared that chance alone brought him so far south, and that
being at Exeter he had determined with himself to see his
relations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until I reached Moreton did I hear of our
uncle&rsquo;s death; then I should have come no farther, but I
knew of your existence, and thought I would at least get a memory
of you.&nbsp; And a very pleasant memory it will be, Cousin, for
you&rsquo;re the queen of the Dartmoors, I hear, and so you
should be.&nbsp; I never want to see a prettier maid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But these statements, despite the speaker&rsquo;s convincing
utterance and bluff manner of discourse, were by no means
true.&nbsp; Nicholas Merle, chancing upon a journal nearly a year
old, had read therein of his miser uncle&rsquo;s passing; and he
knew that only one life stood between him and the dead
man&rsquo;s fortune.&nbsp; So he forsook his usual haunts, to the
satisfaction of better men, and galloped westward to look into
the matter for himself.</p>

144</span>CHAPTER II</h3>
<p>Within less than a week of the young man&rsquo;s arrival at
the &ldquo;Ring o&rsquo; Bells,&rdquo; Minnie was heartily
grieved that she had commissioned Mrs. Trout to hint a hope in
Elias Bassett&rsquo;s ear.&nbsp; She and the gamekeeper had
indeed been close friends before her uncle&rsquo;s death, and it
troubled her that after the change in her fortunes Elias avoided
the old intimacy and feared to be with her alone.&nbsp; Yet she
admired him still, and more than ever, contrasted him with those
who hummed about her like hungry wasps, since her
prosperity.&nbsp; Now, however, to her secret shame, Minnie Merle
began to see that she had dropped the handkerchief too
soon.&nbsp; Upon the very day&mdash;within the actual
hour&mdash;that Bassett received his polite hint, a greater than
Bassett burst upon the vision of Minnie, and soon she hung on her
cousin&rsquo;s words, quite dazzled by the dashing manners of
him, reduced to daily blushes by his gallant address and courtly
fashion of love-making.</p>
<p>These things, however, Elias did not perceive; nor did the
newcomer dazzle him.&nbsp; When the coach from Exeter to Plymouth
left a box for Mr. Merle, and he blossomed forth next Sunday in
russet and <a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>plum-colour, Bassett called him a popin-jay; and the
keeper killed Minnie&rsquo;s old friendship at a breath by
telling her in round terms, with the forceful periods of that
time, that her cousin was either less than he proclaimed himself,
or more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a plain-dealer, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll live to know
it.&nbsp; Ban&rsquo;t natural to bring chapter an&rsquo; verse to
everything a man speaks, same as he does.&nbsp; No honest man
wants a cloud of witnesses to his least act or word.&nbsp; He
goes in fear for all his noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His way may not be ours, Mr. Bassett, but we&rsquo;re a
good deal behind the times, and it does not become you or any
other man to call my cousin in question.&nbsp; He is very
superior and genteel, I&rsquo;m sure, and as for honesty, I never
met a more honest man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ess fay, an&rsquo; you have; an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll
find it out after you&rsquo;m married to un, if not afore,&rdquo;
said Elias, bluntly.</p>
<p>Minnie flamed and frowned angrily upon the speaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very rude speech, and I never expected
to hear you say such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish to God I could say different.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d tell
a lot more against your cousin if I didn&rsquo;t love you
wi&rsquo; all my heart an&rsquo; soul; but, being so set upon
you, I can&rsquo;t speak with a free mind, so I&rsquo;ll speak
nought.&nbsp; Doan&rsquo;t &rsquo;e be vexed wi&rsquo; me, my
dear woman.&nbsp; You know right well as I&rsquo;d go &rsquo;pon
my naked knees from <a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>here to Lunnon town to do your
pleasure.&nbsp; Awnly I ban&rsquo;t blind, an&rsquo; I see how
this dashing chap&rsquo;s bold front have cowed us all round
about.&nbsp; Love of you would keep a man true an&rsquo; honest
if &rsquo;twas in the nature of un so to be, an&rsquo; I
doan&rsquo;t say but Nicholas Merle be right at root; but I
mislike un, &rsquo;cause I&rsquo;m very jealous for you, Minnie
Merle, an&rsquo; I pray you&rsquo;ll take your time an&rsquo; not
jump into his arms fust moment he axes you to marry him, as he
surely means to do come presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl grew a little soothed before this soft answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you mean very well, Elias Bassett,
an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll remember what you say, for it&rsquo;s a
foolish softness toward me that makes you say it.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;m auld friends ever since I came to Two Bridges,
an&rsquo; I doan&rsquo;t think no worse of you for speaking your
mind.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;m quite out o&rsquo; bias.&nbsp; Such a
dashing man as my cousin do carry himself civil an&rsquo; polite
to all, because he can&rsquo;t help it.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis his
smooth custom.&nbsp; He wouldn&rsquo;t think of me as a
wife.&nbsp; Why should he&mdash;a maiden so rough of speech
an&rsquo; manner?&nbsp; An&rsquo; li&rsquo;l enough to look at,
I&rsquo;m sure, to an eye as have often been filled by town-bred
girls.&nbsp; Doan&rsquo;t &rsquo;e fret, theer&rsquo;s a gude
man.&nbsp; He&rsquo;m awnly biding along wi&rsquo; us because he
likes the strong air an&rsquo; the Devonshire cream an&rsquo;
honey.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll be off as he came&mdash;all of a sudden
some fine day, no doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>But
Bassett shook his head, and, indeed, facts presently proved that
he was right, the girl mistaken.&nbsp; Nicholas made no haste to
depart from the Moor.&nbsp; He took mighty rides over it upon his
brimstone-coloured horse; he endeavoured to win the friendship of
all men, and nearly succeeded, for he was generous and a good
sportsman&mdash;sure credentials to the regard of the folk.&nbsp;
Only Bassett and another here and there maintained a stubborn and
doglike mistrust.&nbsp; Nor were the sceptics free of reasons for
their attitude.&nbsp; Elias was laughed at as a man ousted from
hope by a better-equipped rival, and the fact that his undue
bitterness was naturally set to the account of defeated love,
chastened his tongue; but in truth Mr. Bassett&rsquo;s regard for
Minnie had little to do with his emotion.&nbsp; He was an honest
man, and not prejudiced overmuch against young Merle by their
relations.&nbsp; Nevertheless he had a lodged loathing against
him, read craft into his apparent candour, secret policy into his
open-handedness, simulation into his great affectation of being
fellow-well-met with all.&nbsp; A lad of no imagination, Bassett
none the less went heavily in this matter, and was oppressed with
the sense of evil at hand.&nbsp; A dull premonition, to which he
lent himself reluctantly, spread events in their sequence before
him ere they fell out.</p>
<p>Then accident presented him with a solid fact, <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>and that
fact, as is the nature of such things, opened the door to many
problems.&nbsp; But some weeks before the day that his acquired
knowledge set young Bassett&rsquo;s brains upon the whirl, there
had happened the foreseen, and Minnie was engaged to be married
to her cousin.&nbsp; Liquor ran free on the evening of the great
news, and few were those who left the &ldquo;Ring o&rsquo;
Bells&rdquo; in silence and sobriety.&nbsp; Elias at least was
not among them, for, faced with the engagement, he abandoned his
antagonism in a sort of despair, told himself that it was idle to
fight fate, single-handed, and so drank Minnie&rsquo;s health far
into the night and went home to his mother&rsquo;s cottage as
drunk as any man need desire or deplore to be.</p>
<p>The time was then late summer, and the wedding was fixed to
take place at Widecombe in November.&nbsp; This matter
determined, life pursued its level way, and Nicholas Merle, who
appeared to have no business or affairs that called him
elsewhere, dwelt on at the &ldquo;Ring o&rsquo; Bells,&rdquo;
enjoyed the best that the inn could furnish him, and spent his
time between courting his cousin, in a manner much to her taste,
and riding far afield over the land.&nbsp; Sometimes she
accompanied him on her Dartmoor pony, sometimes he went
alone.</p>
<p>There came a day in the bar when Gammer Trout was able to
furnish the company with a morsel of news.</p>
<p><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>&ldquo;Master Merle got a packet by the mail
essterday,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fust as ever he&rsquo;ve
had since he comed; an&rsquo; not to his taste neither.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twill call him off, for he set his teeth and frowned when
he read it, an&rsquo; said as he must be gone in a week an&rsquo;
wouldn&rsquo;t be back much afore the wedding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who might the packet have come from?&rdquo; enquired
Aaron French; but Tibby could not tell.&nbsp; She believed in her
future master and gave the man a short answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s his business.&nbsp; Us all have our
troubles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be the last to speak anything but praise of the
gen&rsquo;leman,&rdquo; declared Aaron.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yet he is a
man of mystery, an&rsquo; his goings an&rsquo; comings work upon
no rule that a plain head can figure out to itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done a purpose,&rdquo; declared Joe Mudge;
&ldquo;nought goes home to a maiden&rsquo;s heart like
mystery.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis meat an&rsquo; drink to a fansical
female.&nbsp; A fellow do bulk large in the innocent eyes of
women folk if they think he&rsquo;ve got a hidden side to
un&mdash;a side as nought but the moon do know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They returned to the subject of the packet; and then it fell
out that, within half an hour of that time, the great fact
already alluded to faced Elias Bassett, and an accident thrust
the fortunes of a man and a woman into his hands.</p>
<p>As he left the &ldquo;Ring o&rsquo; Bells&rdquo; a little
later, his <a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>mind upon the packet, Nicholas Merle himself set out on
horseback, and galloped away in a direction that the keeper
pursued more slowly on foot.&nbsp; And as he viewed the receding
figure, a speck of white suddenly fluttered into the air behind
it and fell upon the moor-path.&nbsp; Ignorant of his loss, the
rider went forward, and Bassett, convinced that he had seen the
identical object of recent discussion, marched along his
way.&nbsp; His purpose, arrived at hastily, was to pick up the
letter, conceal it, and give it to Minnie with the frank advice
that she would do well to read it; but in the event he did no
such thing, for as he stooped to gather up the paper, a thud of
hoofs came to his ear and he saw that Nicholas Merle had
discovered his loss and was returning to make it good if
possible.</p>
<p>He dropped the writing unseen, a flash of wisdom leading to
that course; but he did not do so until two words had chanced to
fall upon his eyes&mdash;two words of such tremendous
significance that they quite dazed the mind of Elias.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dear husband</i>&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He read that much, then moved quickly away from the letter and
pretended to be picking and eating blackberries a hundred yards
distant, as Merle rode past him with his eyes straining to right
and left of the way.&nbsp; The rider banished his care and
cracked a jest with Bassett; then, looking <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>backward,
without appearing to do so, Elias saw Merle dismount and clutch
up his letter.&nbsp; A moment later he resumed his ride, and went
whistling along upon his great, bright horse.</p>
<h3><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>CHAPTER III</h3>
<p>The first inclination of Elias Bassett was to meet his rival,
man to man, and settle this outrage by force of arms; but after
four-and-twenty-hours with himself he decided against that
course.&nbsp; To do the best for Minnie without afterthought for
his own gain was now the keeper&rsquo;s duty.&nbsp; He put
himself resolutely out of the question, and even debated whether
he should impart his discovery to another, and so stand aloof
from the necessary deed; but his nature would not go so far along
with him.&nbsp; He was a man faced with a rascal and an enemy,
and that rascal must be unmasked by him, not another.&nbsp; The
work before him was in itself so congenial that to delay proved
difficult.&nbsp; Therefore Elias quickly planned his course of
action, and the hour for it.&nbsp; Yet he was disappointed, for
on the morning of a day that he had fixed to confront Merle and
break the evil news to Minnie, Nicholas himself departed
unexpectedly.&nbsp; He was to be absent until the time of the
wedding.</p>
<p>Upon this circumstance Bassett pondered through another day,
then suddenly strange matters hurried his decision and anger
opened his lips.</p>
<p><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>Returning by night to the hamlet of Two Bridges over
the high Moor, Elias met Minnie Merle alone walking quickly
toward the lonely gorges of West Dart, where the river roars and
echoes under Wistman&rsquo;s primeval wood of oaks.&nbsp;
Darkness was already come, but a moon hidden under low clouds
made all clear.&nbsp; Only the river, full after a freshet,
filled the silence with ebb and flow of watery music, that waxed
and waned upon the wind.&nbsp; The lonely wood, shunned even by
day and held a haunted region by night, huddled there like a
concourse of misshapen goblins.&nbsp; Huge planes of shattered
granite sank from the hills to the river valley, and the red fox
and shining adder alone found a home in this fantastic forest of
humped, twisted and shrivelled trees.&nbsp; But to Minnie the
desolate spot was good.&nbsp; She associated it with her lover;
there, when the sunlight shone and little blue butterflies danced
above the briars, Nicholas had asked her to marry him; and now,
under gathering night, it was upon a secret errand connected with
her cousin that she stole along when the keeper met her, to their
common surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A strange hour for a walk, sure enough!&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;What wonnerful secret be taking you on the
Moor at this time of night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It be a secret,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;so ax me no
more about it, an&rsquo; go on your way.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you another secret for yours,
Minnie Merle.&nbsp; Wheer be you gwaine so quick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Wistman&rsquo;s Wood&mdash;that much I&rsquo;ll let
you know&mdash;no more.&nbsp; Now go your way, Elias, like a gude
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ban&rsquo;t you feared?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not of Wistman&rsquo;s Wood.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis nought
but a cluster of honest old trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll come along with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; I won&rsquo;t let you.&nbsp; Three&rsquo;s no
company.&rdquo;&nbsp; Elias stared and shifted his walking-stick
from one hand to the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gwaine to meet somebody?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would your young man say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Minnie laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you ax, I think I may answer that he&rsquo;d say
I was in the right.&nbsp; Now you know enough&mdash;tu
much.&nbsp; Leave me&mdash;I won&rsquo;t have you go another yard
with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do know tu much for my peace,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;but &rsquo;tis you who don&rsquo;t know enough.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve waited a longful time to speak, but now I&rsquo;ll do
it, though I break your heart.&nbsp; Better that than
ruination.&nbsp; This man&mdash;Nicholas Merle&mdash;he&rsquo;m
married, an&rsquo; that packet he got&mdash;&rsquo;twas from his
ill-served wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You coward; you liar; you wicked, venomous
snake!&rdquo; cried out Minnie.&nbsp; &ldquo;To stand theer afore
<a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>your
Maker an&rsquo; hatch that lie for the ear of a loving
woman!&nbsp; Oh! I wish I was a man; I&rsquo;d tear&mdash;but he
shall&mdash;he shall&mdash;he shall know it this
night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her passion revealed her secret.&nbsp; She saw what she had
done, grew a little calmer and explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the last time I&rsquo;ll ever foul my breath
with your name, Elias Bassett; but since you&rsquo;ve surprised
this out of me, I must say more.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;ve a shadow
of honour, you&rsquo;ll keep a secret I swore not to reveal to a
soul, yet have now revealed in anger to you.&nbsp; The fault was
yours.&nbsp; When my true love went away, he told me that I might
find to-day a letter in a secret spot known to both of us far
away upon the Moreton road.&nbsp; I went there&mdash;rode my pony
out this morning&mdash;and a letter waited me.&nbsp; I tell you
these things that you shall breed no more lies against him or
me.&nbsp; In that note he told me that he should be at
Wistman&rsquo;s Wood to-night at a familiar spot I wot very
well.&nbsp; And he is to let me into gert news.&nbsp; Wonnerful
things have happened to him.&nbsp; But he is supposed to be far
away, and that he is tarrying here is my secret.&nbsp; And now
you have surprised it out of me.&nbsp; At least I can trust you
not to breathe of this to any living soul if ever you loved
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall keep silent, be sure, since you find it in your
heart to give me the lie and call me
&lsquo;snake.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw the letter that you pretend to have seen.&nbsp;
<a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>He
showed it to me.&nbsp; Not that I asked to see it.&nbsp; I would
trust Nicholas before the sun.&nbsp; You are dreaming, or else
very wicked.&nbsp; The packet was from a scrivener.&nbsp; It
concerned money.&nbsp; &lsquo;A wife&rsquo;!&nbsp; This is
jealous madness.&nbsp; He never looked at any woman before he met
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I be wrong, I&rsquo;ll beg his pardon on my
knees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You be most wickedly wrong.&nbsp; He is the soul of
honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let me come now with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for the world.&nbsp; He would never forgive me if
anybody heard of this meeting.&nbsp; It is vital to his interests
that it should be supposed he is far away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cannot you see there is danger for you in
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danger with him?&nbsp; How little you know what love
means for all your talk, Elias!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is because I know what love means that I care so
much.&nbsp; Let me be somewhere near&mdash;out of sight and
earshot of speech, but not too far off for a cry to reach me if
you wanted help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each word you say makes me hate you worse, Elias
Bassett.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least let me stop here an&rsquo; see you home again
afterward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve done with you.&nbsp; You
ban&rsquo;t a good man.&nbsp; Besides, you would have to wait for
<a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>hours.&nbsp; I be very early for our meeting.&nbsp;
Nicholas will not be there afore eleven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if you never come home again, Minnie
Merle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you may tell all men what you have heard to-night,
an&rsquo; go an&rsquo; seek for me.&nbsp; If Nicholas knowed you
were his enemy, he would shoot you like a dog.&nbsp; So be
warned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet you cannot see that if he is married already,
you are his worst enemy!&nbsp; He can&rsquo;t marry you and get
the money that way, so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned and ran from him without another word, and he
watched her sink into grey moonlight until the Moor swallowed her
up.&nbsp; A dim spot a mile away on the night marked
Wistman&rsquo;s Wood; and from it, through the fitful noise of
the river, an owl&rsquo;s cry came faintly, like the sound of a
wailing child.</p>
<h3><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<p>Elias sat upon a rock and so remained a long while with his
head between his hands.&nbsp; Then he got up and walked slowly
homeward; while Minnie Merle, despite the fact that she was far
too early for her appointment, proceeded steadily toward
Wistman&rsquo;s Wood.&nbsp; Presently, with a light, sure foot,
she entered the old forest and passed where auburn autumn foliage
rustled under the wan light.&nbsp; The wind sighed here and there
in the stunted timber, then died off and left the place
breathless, awake, watching as it seemed.</p>
<p>There was a familiar tree whose boughs, heavily draped with
grey lichen and metallic-coloured mosses, made amongst them a
comfortable sort of couch.&nbsp; The low branches scarcely sprung
above the rocky earth, and many a deep cleft and cranny lay
beneath the withered boles.&nbsp; Here the wood-rush flourished,
and the briar, and the little corydalis shared sunny corners with
the snake on summer days.&nbsp; Where Minnie now climbed, that
her head might rise above the low crowns of the wood, ivy and
whortleberry grew, and polypody ferns extended along the limbs of
the tree.&nbsp; About each dwarf, <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>bleared and hoary, moved festoons of
ash-coloured lichen, like ghostly dryads grown old.&nbsp; The
arms of the trees were bedded with centuries of decayed
vegetation, their trunks were twisted into the shape of fossil
beasts; yet life was strong in them; yearly they broke their
amber buds; yearly they blossomed and bore fruit.</p>
<p>Gazing about her and wondering from whence her mysterious
lover would appear, Minnie was suddenly startled to see a huge
creature moving in the night.&nbsp; It came toward her, magnified
by the moon.&nbsp; Supposing it some wandering ox from the herds
of half-wild cattle that roamed the Moor, she was glad of her
elevated security; but the object proved a horse, and on it a man
sat&mdash;the man she loved best in the world.&nbsp; Nicholas was
also very early, and, well pleased to find it so, his sweetheart
prepared to leap out of her refuge and run to him, when something
made her hesitate and she waited a moment and watched her lover
dismount.</p>
<p>He carried a curious long parcel under his arm, and the girl
wondered what manner of gift this might be.&nbsp; Then, within
twenty yards of her hiding-place, Nicholas Merle, having
consulted a big watch, proceeded to a curious occupation that
first puzzled the watcher, then froze her young limbs with an
awful chill not born of cold.</p>
<p>First, tethering his horse on the high ground above <a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>the wood,
the man lighted a lantern, set his pistols at his elbow on a
stone, and turned to the long parcel he had brought with
him.&nbsp; From this he unwound some rope and produced a spade
and a short, heavy pick.&nbsp; He took off his coat, rolled up
his sleeves and sought a place for digging.&nbsp; Presently a
hollow between two great slabs of granite met his view, and
carefully thrusting away the briars, ferns and honeysuckle that
draped this spot, he set to work and began deepening it with his
tools.&nbsp; A mound quickly grew at hand, and a long, narrow
hole began to yawn between the shelves of stone.&nbsp; He toiled
with all his might and feared not to sing at his labour.&nbsp;
Then, as he lifted his voice, the words he uttered told his deed
to the girl who, above in the ancient oak, looked down through a
screen of red leaves.&nbsp; She shook so that the dry foliage
rustled all about her, but Nicholas Merle&rsquo;s own melody
filled his ear and he sang the historic song of another he once
had watched mimicking the same business that now engaged him in
earnest:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A pickaxe, and a spade, a spade,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For and a shrouding sheet:<br />
O! a pit of clay for to be made<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For such a guest is meet.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the girl in the tree grasped the friendly limbs and
cowered close and set her teeth to save <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>herself
from fainting and falling, for she knew that she watched the
digging of her own grave.&nbsp; She struggled with herself to
think what she should do; but to solve that problem was easy
enough.&nbsp; Her life depended upon the sheltering tree.&nbsp;
The pistol that glittered at Merle&rsquo;s elbow was waiting for
her young heart.</p>
<p>Half an hour before their appointed time of meeting Merle
finished his labours, hid his tools, trailed the weeds over his
work and then, putting on his coat, blew out the lantern and sat
down to wait his cousin&rsquo;s arrival.&nbsp; And presently,
while Minnie watched and wondered how long his patience would
keep him in Wistman&rsquo;s Wood, and how long her strength would
bear the ordeal of this terror under nightly cold, she saw
another shape, and a tall man&rsquo;s form suddenly heaved up out
of the darkness.</p>
<p>He approached the other, and spoke.&nbsp; Then the girl felt
her fears almost at an end, for it was Elias Bassett.&nbsp; He
had indeed turned his face homeward, but could not find it in his
heart to obey Minnie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Late work and strange work, neighbour,&rdquo; said the
keeper.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve bided hidden an&rsquo; watched
you this hour, an&rsquo; yet I be so much in the dark as when I
comed.&nbsp; Who are you, and what do you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mind my business, and do you the like, if you are a
wise man!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>&ldquo;Why!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis Nicholas Merle!&nbsp; I
thought you had gone home to your wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other rose and Elias saw his teeth flash white under the
moon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You rash fool, are you so weary of living that you come
here to hunt for your death?&nbsp; Yes, Nick Merle&mdash;a name
that if you were a northern clown instead of a Westerner, would
make you shake in your shoes.&nbsp; You know too much, my good
clod.&nbsp; You had been wiser to leave this wood alone to-night,
for leave it again you never will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet that grave was not dug for me, I
suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, since you are curious.&nbsp; But I can find room
for two in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He snatched up a pistol and fired point-blank.&nbsp; Bassett
felt a fiery stab in his shoulder; then he dashed in and
closed.&nbsp; The men rolled together upon the ground, but
handicapped by his wound, the keeper had little chance.&nbsp; His
grip relaxed, his head fell back, and the other, who knew that he
had hit him, supposed the man was dead.&nbsp; Merle dragged his
foe to the grave, and rolled him in without ceremony; then,
seeing that Elias moved, hearing that he moaned, the rascal
turned to get his second pistol and make an end of the
matter.&nbsp; But the pistol was in another hand.&nbsp; Minnie
had seen her old suitor slain, as she supposed, and a great grief
for the moment banished personal fear.&nbsp; <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>In that
moment she acted, leapt quickly to the boulders beneath her
hiding-place, crept near the battle unseen, and, as her cousin
returned and stood erect, she confronted him with his own weapon
raised and cocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brave heart!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;You had come
to my rescue, dear Minnie, but, thank Heaven, I was one too many
for this blackguardly footpad myself.&nbsp; He had traced me, how
I know not, and wanted my watch.&nbsp; But he&rsquo;ll need the
time no more.&nbsp; He sleeps, and no stroke but the stroke of
doom will waken him again.&nbsp; Give me my pistol, dear
heroine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not
deceived.&nbsp; I know my life is in my hand, and I am not going
to put it into yours.&nbsp; Come an inch nearer and I will shoot
you, for you are a murderer, and worse than a
murderer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man fell back.&nbsp; He had himself taught Minnie to shoot
with small arms, and he knew that she was a good pupil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down and let us talk,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With that poor man groaning his life out
there&mdash;for me?&nbsp; Go&mdash;go now.&nbsp; If I was not a
weak fool, I would shoot you in cold blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He reflected rapidly, then so acted that he might deceive her
into his reach, and surprise the weapon from her before she could
use it.</p>
<p><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>&ldquo;You will live to regret this dreadful error,
Minnie Merle.&nbsp; No man or woman wrongs me without suffering
for it.&nbsp; There is some treachery here; but I will be even
with my enemies.&nbsp; I always am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went slowly toward his horse and she hung back and let him
lead the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little did I think when I taught you how to use that
toy that you would one night turn it against your faithful
lover,&rdquo; he said with deep sorrow in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen you dig my grave,&rdquo; she
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are not worthy to live.&nbsp; Go,
because I have loved you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He slowly mounted into his saddle, very slowly gathered his
heavy hunting-crop that hung hitched to the holster; then, as
quick as lightning, he hit out with the heavy handle, trusting to
strike the girl on the head and bring her down before she could
fire.</p>
<p>Minnie started backward, and, to her horror, the jerk of her
movement, although it saved her life from the blow, exploded the
pistol.&nbsp; Now, defenceless, she prepared to fly, but the
man&rsquo;s laugh of triumph was broken by a horrid scream of
pain from his horse.&nbsp; The ball had struck it high on the
neck and the great brute reared up and became unmanageable.&nbsp;
So sudden was the action that Merle came off.&nbsp; A second more
and he would have rolled into safety; but, at the moment of his
collapse, even as <a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>he fell, the frantic creature kicked out and a
steel-plated hoof, with the strength of a flying chain-shot,
crashed into his head behind the ear and cut away half his
skull.&nbsp; Under the moon oozed forth the brains that had
plotted Minnie&rsquo;s death, and she turned shuddering, while
the great horse, with a cry almost human, galloped into the
night.</p>
<p>Bassett lived, as Minnie soon discovered.&nbsp; His wound
still bled, but she tore her linen, stanched the flow and
supported him upon the way until his strength gave out again and
he sank down upon the Moor, while she fled forward for
succour.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>The name of Bassett warms Devon hearts to-day, and it was the
generation that followed Elias that wrote their worthy patronymic
large upon the earth and blazoned it in history.&nbsp; Yet the
sons of Minnie, and her grandsons and great-grandsons, loved best
in their annals that tragedy of the highwayman, their
mother&rsquo;s cousin&mdash;Young Nick, as he is called&mdash;and
the story of his efforts to prevent them from coming into the
world by sending their mother out of it.&nbsp; They have waxed
high in the land, and men have blessed them; yet their joy in Sir
Elias Bassett, Lord Moreton, is not greater than that they take
in plain Elias, the statesman&rsquo;s grandfather.&nbsp; Men made
a riddle about Minnie Merle and her grave&mdash;a jest that sets
three generations laughing; but <a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>of late this joke has hidden within
the pages of old, curious journals.&nbsp; There, indeed, many
such-like strange matters shall be met with.&nbsp; Long they lie
forgotten, buried in an ancient chronicle, tombed for centuries
under the lumber of a muniment chest, until bidden to rise and
live again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I publish the banns of marriage between Jonas
Lethbridge, bachelor, and Dinah Mary Hannaford, spinster, both of
this parish.&nbsp; If any of you know cause, or just impediment,
why these two persons should not be joined together in holy
matrimony, ye are to declare it.&nbsp; This is for the first time
of asking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pleasant rustle ran through the little congregation&mdash;an
amiable and friendly sound.&nbsp; Jonas and Dinah sat together
through the ordeal of the banns, and, out of sight, he squeezed
her hand to support her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The maiden went so red as a rose, an&rsquo; the man
pale as a dog&rsquo;s tooth.&nbsp; Did &rsquo;e note it?&rdquo;
asked Blacksmith Chugg of Sexton Lethbridge, after service was at
an end and the village folk had vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I noted that, and more than that.&nbsp; Old as I am,
and so round in the back as a beetle with a lifetime o&rsquo;
burying, yet my eyes be gimlets o&rsquo; sharpness still, <a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>thank
God!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a trick my son Jonas have gotten from his
mother.&nbsp; The red never comed in her cheek at high
moments&mdash;blood all rushed to her heart, an&rsquo; her growed
so white you might have thought as her was going to die on the
spot.&nbsp; When I axed her to marry me, she went fainty-like,
an&rsquo; her lips turned blue.&nbsp; But a good wife she was as
ever a man lost an&rsquo; mourned.&nbsp; They wondered how I
could find nature enough in me to dig her pit myself.&nbsp; The
fools!&nbsp; To think that a grave-digger like me could have
rested easy in my bed if another had done it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope as Dinah Hannaford will be such a wife an&rsquo;
mother as your missis an&rsquo; mine,&rdquo; said the
blacksmith.&nbsp; &ldquo;But why for did tenor bell&mdash;that
chap, Amos Thorn, the woodman&mdash;get up an&rsquo; leave the
church when they was axed out?&nbsp; A very unseasonable think to
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I marked it,&rdquo; answered Mr. Lethbridge.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Jonas says that Dinah kept company two years back with
Thorn.&nbsp; But they falled out, because he have such a surly
habit of mind an&rsquo; her couldn&rsquo;t put up with his
tantrums no more.&nbsp; If her so much as looked at another man
or gived a chap &lsquo;good-day,&rsquo; Thorn would go crazy;
an&rsquo; as life promised to be a burdensome business wi&rsquo;
such a touchy fashion o&rsquo; man, she took courage to break
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very sensible maid, they say.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>&ldquo;So she is, then; never seed any young woman with
more sense.&nbsp; They be coming to live along wi&rsquo;
me.&nbsp; Then my old sister, as does for me now, can go off
comfortable into that empty almshouse offered her to
Tavistock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsewhere the lovers walked and talked in a Devon lane.&nbsp;
Her arm rested upon his, and grim exultation marked his
features.&nbsp; Stern and hard was his countenance, yet his eyes
glowed kindly and flashed with love as he looked down at her
face.&nbsp; Ferns in all the glory of new green hung fronds about
the way; seeding grasses softened the verdant banks, and flowers
brightened them with red and purple.&nbsp; Field-roses and
dog-roses trailed their beauty above, and in the air was scent of
eglantine and song of bird.&nbsp; Speedwells and cinquefoil made
blue-and-gold lace-work in the vernal walls of the lane; hawthorn
turned to roseal harmonies in death, and the last bluebells
faded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll love me for ever, my own dear?&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Till my heart be done wi&rsquo; beating, Dinah,&rdquo;
he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;No trouble as was ever hatched by man
or the devil will come betwixt you an&rsquo; me.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>CHAPTER II</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I publish the banns of marriage between Amos Thorn,
bachelor, and Dinah Mary Hannaford, spinster, both of this
parish.&nbsp; If any of you know cause, or just impediment, why
these two persons should not be joined together in holy
matrimony, ye are to declare it.&nbsp; This is for the first time
of asking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again there followed a rustle of many curious folk; but a
different emotion animated it, a different sound infused
it.&nbsp; Human nature woke up and buzzed.&nbsp; This was more
than merely pleasant; it was interesting.&nbsp; Mr. Thorn and
Dinah Hannaford were not in the little church to face two hundred
pairs of eyes.&nbsp; Jonas Lethbridge accompanied his father, and
while the ancient grave-digger&rsquo;s head drooped and his mouth
trembled, where it fell in over naked gums, the young man gazed
unflinchingly before him, and no quiver marked his strong, hard
face and dark eyes.&nbsp; He kept them fixed unblinking on a
stained glass window that represented Christ bidding the waves be
still.</p>
<p>Again the old-time neighbour of Sexton Lethbridge stumped
along beside him under spring leaves; but <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>Jonas had
disappeared as soon as the service was ended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very sorry for your son, my dear soul; for I lay the
fire in his eye was burning out of his heart if us could have but
seen it,&rdquo; said Mr. Chugg, the blacksmith.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
a courage he&rsquo;ve got to come to worship!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a very dreadful thing for all of us,
Chugg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lethbridge spoke wearily.&nbsp; Of late his natural forces
were abated, and Jonas did much of the work of the
churchyard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every maiden in the village be sorry for him,&rdquo;
said the blacksmith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; well they might be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thorn hadn&rsquo;t the brass to be there hisself, I
see.&nbsp; A chap from Princetown ringed tenor bell
to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God won&rsquo;t never prosper such treachery, you mark
me,&rdquo; said Mr. Lethbridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If &rsquo;tis God&rsquo;s business to put down
treachery, He&rsquo;m a thought behind His work&mdash;to say it
respectful.&nbsp; My experience is that the ungodly do very well
&rsquo;pon Dartymoor.&nbsp; Be your sister going to bide with
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; she&rsquo;m stopping.&nbsp; Her wouldn&rsquo;t go
in the almshouse when the wedding fell through.&nbsp; But it
won&rsquo;t be for long.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m getting ripe an&rsquo;
ready for the grave myself now.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>&ldquo;The women of this generation ban&rsquo;t no
better than reptile toads.&nbsp; But your young chap will find a
good wife come presently, please God.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a tidy
maid here an&rsquo; there yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not him.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll bide a bachelor for
evermore.&nbsp; He&rsquo;m so bitter as gall to the roots of his
being since she wrote that letter.&nbsp; It have turned him away
from the Almighty&rsquo;s Self.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chucked him over with a letter, did her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ess&mdash;an&rsquo; a very nice fashion of
penmanship.&nbsp; Yet all written wi&rsquo; needles, so to say,
as stabbed the poor young youth cruel.&nbsp; He gasped when he
read it, as if he&rsquo;d swallowed his meat wrong way.&nbsp;
Then he handed it to me.&nbsp; She just said as she&rsquo;d been
wickedly deceived in him, and that she&rsquo;d rather have
trusted the sun not to shine than believe he could have acted so
bad to her.&nbsp; An&rsquo; she also hoped the Lord would forgive
him for treating a poor maiden so crooked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That weern&rsquo;t enough for Jonas Lethbridge, was
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, by Gor!&nbsp; He went straight to her, an&rsquo;
there was fiery words; but the truth, or what she thought was
truth, he never knowed.&nbsp; Her love had turned to hate in a
single night.&nbsp; He pressed for reasons; and she said that to
ax for reasons was the worst insult of all, seeing she knowed the
whole secret truth about him.&nbsp; Not a word more could he get,
<a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>though
he tried, and was patient as Job for an hour of talk.&nbsp; Then,
having his spark o&rsquo; passion like any other man, he called
her a wanton, wicked jilt an&rsquo; left her.&nbsp; An&rsquo; no
girl ever deserved hard names more than she.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a dark story, to be sure.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
why us never heard the third axing of the banns, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It happened last spring, afore the last axing.&nbsp;
Then, come winter, Dinah Hannaford&rsquo;s mother died, an&rsquo;
next thing us heard was that she&rsquo;d got on wi&rsquo; Amos
Thorn again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very womanly piece of work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether &rsquo;tis woman or man be
at the bottom.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d throw blame on Thorn if I dared
wi&rsquo;out running danger of violence; but I be old an&rsquo;
weak, an&rsquo; &rsquo;tis no good saying things you can&rsquo;t
enforce wi&rsquo; your right arm.&nbsp; Still, I do think he
kindiddled her away from my boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis no libel to think it, anyway,&rdquo; said
Mr. Chugg, and the sexton nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s parties as ought to be punished wheether
or no,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I hope the A&rsquo;mighty
won&rsquo;t let it pass, an&rsquo; that I&rsquo;ll live to see
the wicked come by their deserts.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>A mile away Amos Thorn and Dinah walked together where
immortal flowers bloomed about them at the dawn of June.</p>
<p><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>&ldquo;Oh, but you&rsquo;ll be true to me, dear
heart&mdash;I can trust you?&rdquo; she asked with a pleading
voice.</p>
<p>The big blond man turned and hugged her to himself and kissed
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For ever an&rsquo; ever, Amen, my pretty!&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<h3><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>CHAPTER III</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God of His great
mercy to take unto Himself the soul of our dear brother here
departed, we therefore commit his body to the ground; earth to
earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust; in sure and certain
hope&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clods fell; the familiar rite ended.&nbsp; There was a
smell of earth and bruised grass.&nbsp; Dinah Thorn looked down
into her husband&rsquo;s grave; and her child of three, clutching
tight his mother&rsquo;s black-gloved hand, peeped fearfully into
the abyss that had swallowed his father.&nbsp; Suddenly the
infant appeared to realize his loss, and howled with all his
little heart.</p>
<p>Anon every man went to his own house, while Mr. Lethbridge
began to fill the grave.&nbsp; His friend the blacksmith had been
one of the bearers.&nbsp; He, too, stayed behind; and now Chugg
lighted his pipe, and sat upon a tomb, and watched the
sexton.&nbsp; Once more they played the part of chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a wonder to see you with the spade
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to that, I&rsquo;m past it&mdash;have been these
three year&mdash;but this particular job&mdash;well, somehow, <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>Jonas had
got a feeling that he&rsquo;d cussed the chap so often in life
that he couldn&rsquo;t dig his pit decent; an&rsquo; I be clever
yet for such an old blid, so I comed out o&rsquo; my well-earned
rest.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t say as it hurt my mind to dig, though my
rheumatics will smart for it come to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The earth dropped from the shovel, and the coffin beneath
rumbled to the thud.</p>
<p>Old Lethbridge worked slowly, and stopped often to talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas always said he&rsquo;d got a careless way
of throwing elms.&nbsp; An&rsquo; now an elm have throwed
him.&nbsp; A great tree in Widecombe Park falled when he was
looking t&rsquo;other way, an&rsquo; a bough scat his brains
out.&nbsp; An&rsquo; now he&rsquo;m coffined in elm, an&rsquo;
never good wood held a worse man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blacksmith smoked and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet the Church feels no doubts of him.&nbsp; Have
&rsquo;e ever marked the cocksureness of the parsons?&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis that I marvels at!&nbsp; &lsquo;Sure and sartain
hope&rsquo; be the words.&nbsp; When they buried Sam Pridham, the
poacher&mdash;him as beat his wife and drinked the boots
an&rsquo; shoes off his children&rsquo;s feet&mdash;parson was
just so dead positive &rsquo;bout it as when he put away my old
woman, who was a holy saint o&rsquo; God, bar her temper.&nbsp;
How can us know that it have pleased the A&rsquo;mighty to take
to Hisself the soul of this here Amos Thorn?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t be sure, and for my part I
ban&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;We know mighty
little of any man except this: that king and tinker breed the
same fashion o&rsquo; worms come they die.&nbsp; The chap down
there was a liar, an&rsquo; he won Dinah Hannaford from my son by
a wicked trick.&nbsp; He told her falsehoods&mdash;&rsquo;twas
this dust I&rsquo;m covering with honest earth that made dust of
my son&rsquo;s life; an&rsquo;, old as I am, I be glad to bury
him.&nbsp; If &rsquo;tis wicked, then &rsquo;tis wicked; but, any
way, &rsquo;tis true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t puff an&rsquo; fret, my dear.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;m gone now, an&rsquo; &rsquo;tis very bad for you to be
so hot at your age.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll get his proper
payment.&nbsp; For that matter, he have got it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say us have no right to believe that God have took
this man&rsquo;s soul to Hisself.&nbsp; It ban&rsquo;t justice,
an&rsquo; I won&rsquo;t stomach it.&nbsp; Nice company for the
bettermost in heaven!&nbsp; The like of Amos Thorn&mdash;!&nbsp;
Tchut!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t onderstand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a very difficult question, and best left
alone,&rdquo; said the blacksmith, uneasily.&nbsp; &ldquo;It be
quite enough to know there is such a place.&nbsp; I never much
like to think about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Us have more right to commit his soul to the Dowl,
an&rsquo; a lot more reason, too,&rdquo; said the angry
ancient.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do &rsquo;e think I&rsquo;ve read an&rsquo;
pondered the Scriptures fifty years for nothing?&nbsp; The wages
of sin be death; that&rsquo;s a cast-iron, black-an&rsquo;-white
<a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>fact;
and I&rsquo;ll back the Bible against the Prayer-book any day of
the week for money.&nbsp; If Bible&rsquo;s true, he&rsquo;m
lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The punishment do fall on his wife an&rsquo; child,
come to think of it.&nbsp; He was cut off so sudden, an&rsquo;
left no provision for &rsquo;em at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the law and the prophets,&rdquo; declared
Mr. Lethbridge.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sins of the fathers be visited on
the children&mdash;also pretty often on the widows, though they
ban&rsquo;t named by name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the justice of that, then?&nbsp; Got you
there!&rdquo; cried the blacksmith, triumphantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve got anybody, you&rsquo;ve got the Old
Testament,&rdquo; answered the other, grimly, &ldquo;an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;d advise you to call home your words again, an&rsquo; not
flout the Book o&rsquo; Life in a graveyard.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twon&rsquo;t be for your good.&nbsp; An&rsquo; such things
will turn the scale at Judgement.&nbsp; The man was cut off,
an&rsquo; &rsquo;tis the quality of punishment not to stop at the
sinner, but to catch the innocent folk all around him&mdash;like
measles or a fever do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a husband, it be generally granted he was a very
good an&rsquo; proper man,&rdquo; ventured Mr. Chugg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be a good husband and a bad
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;m so quick at words, there&rsquo;s no being
even with ye!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>Then
the blacksmith went his way, and his friend shouted after
him:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Justice be justice; an&rsquo; for my part I&rsquo;ll
always tell the truth, as I always have, whether it be to a
man&rsquo;s face or his coffin-lid.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<p>There came a day after long years, and June smiled as of yore,
and the scythe of Jonas Lethbridge smoothed the grassy graveyard,
even as the scythe of Time filled it.&nbsp; He took a gloomy
pride in the place; and while his father, who now slept beneath,
had been content to dig deep and bury well, this silent man
passed his abstracted days among the graves, and made the face of
the little churchyard fair to see.</p>
<p>Few problems troubled him; yet upon this hour in young summer
he was faced with a difficulty.&nbsp; He paused, looked with
down-drawn brows at a faint path worn in the grass between
certain tombs.&nbsp; It was a way trodden there by a
woman&rsquo;s feet, and it led&mdash;not to the grave of Amos
Thorn, but to a little mound near it, where the woodman&rsquo;s
son slept beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t spoke a word to her since her flinged me
over, an&rsquo; never thought to; but &rsquo;tis my duty,&rdquo;
the sexton reflected, &ldquo;an&rsquo; my duty I must do.&nbsp; I
could set sticks across, but she&rsquo;d only think I was
&rsquo;feared of her.&nbsp; For that matter, so I be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Opportunity offered within the hour.&nbsp; The man <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>mowed, and
the blackbirds sang.&nbsp; From an ancient tomb, long sunk out of
straightness, came a tapping where a thrush broke a snail and
feasted upon it.&nbsp; The air danced, and the scythe&rsquo;s
strokes rose and fell regularly, like the deep breath of a
sleeper.</p>
<p>Then came a woman, and her feet pressed the grasses where
Lethbridge had too often marked their passing.&nbsp; His face
grew white, his brows frowned, and he put down his scythe and
came forward.&nbsp; Dinah saw him, and hesitated and stood
still.&nbsp; A little bunch of purple columbines fell out of her
hand, and she bent and picked them up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Thorn,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;I must ax you
to go around t&rsquo;other way to your graves in future.&nbsp; I
won&rsquo;t have &rsquo;e trapsing about here.&nbsp; You&rsquo;m
wearing the young grass away.&nbsp; See how bad it do look.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; if you&rsquo;d only let your child&rsquo;s grave alone,
the turves would jine suent and smooth; but you&rsquo;m always
putting in jam-jars wi&rsquo; flowers in &rsquo;em, an&rsquo;
planting things that die, an&rsquo; worrying the place so cruel
that no grass can grow.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to say nought to
hurt your mother&rsquo;s heart, but the grave will never look
seemly the way you treat it; and I shall be blamed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood in a dream to hear his voice again.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
tears could make it grow&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tears!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a poor, feeble sorrow tears
will drown.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>&ldquo;Men an&rsquo; women be different.&nbsp; Tears do
soften the cutting edge to us females.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll go
round t&rsquo;other way henceforth, Mr. Lethbridge, an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;m very sorry I hurt the grass and troubled you about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked hard at her, and the mists of memory rose a little
from off his spirit.&nbsp; Life had left him petrified, while for
the woman the years were full, mostly of sorrow.&nbsp; Her
husband and child were both dead, and she lived alone.</p>
<p>Now the man&rsquo;s cold heart felt a throb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis strange to hear your voice,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do &rsquo;e ever think &rsquo;bout the old
days, ma&rsquo;am, or do they hurt &rsquo;e?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think an&rsquo; I
suffer.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ve lived a lifetime since
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you ban&rsquo;t very old now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-six, Mr. Lethbridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that well enough&mdash;twenty-six come tenth
o&rsquo; next month&mdash;July.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was very sorry for &rsquo;e when your old faither
died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So was I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never would speak to me after&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faither was a very great man for justice.&nbsp; An Old
Testament man, you might say.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas he as digged your
husband&rsquo;s grave, Mrs. Thorn.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t do
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>&ldquo;Amos Thorn wronged you more&rsquo;n ever a man
wronged a man&mdash;God rest his soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; he wronged you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve forgived him,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told you as I had a woman an&rsquo; a child hidden
down to Newton Abbot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve forgived him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; you could believe it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never forgived myself, nor never
shall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;ll keep off this here place
an&rsquo; go round by the old stones there, I&rsquo;ll thank
you.&nbsp; I take a pride in the burying-ground, as be well
known.&nbsp; The graves be wife and children to me.&nbsp; If
you&rsquo;ll look around at other churchyards, you&rsquo;ll see
there ban&rsquo;t one this side of Plymouth that&rsquo;s so trim
and tidy as this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s well known; people comes from long ways off
to see it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be careful in future not to do
harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned, and followed the road that he pointed out.&nbsp;
Then she put fresh water in a jam-pot, and arranged the
columbines upon a little mound of sickly turf.&nbsp; Hard by his
scythe began its measured rhythm in the heart of the green
grass.</p>

186</span>CHAPTER V</h3>
<p>The light took a golden tincture before dusk, and nature
rested.&nbsp; Mellow sunshine cast long shadows, interspersed
with a tender radiance; the cottages and house-places were still;
and peace brooded over hamlet and homestead, for the day&rsquo;s
work was done.</p>
<p>The 10th of July sank to lovely close, and through a blue dusk
one window glimmered on the confines of the village.</p>
<p>Toward it walked a man, and in his pocket he carried a little
parcel.&nbsp; Once he hesitated, and seemed disposed to hurl his
gift into the hedge and return whence he came.&nbsp; But he held
on, and presently reached the cottage door and knocked at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might I come in an&rsquo; have a tell, Mrs.
Thorn?&rdquo; he asked in a deep voice.</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence, then a fluttered uprising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you&rsquo;m in a mind to, Mr.
Lethbridge.&rdquo;</p>

187</span>BENJAMIN&rsquo;S MESS</h2>
<p><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>When
Farmer Yelland died, everybody in Postbridge village was
sorry&mdash;for theirselves, but not for him, mind you.&nbsp;
Because if ever a good man went straight to glory &rsquo;twas
Michael Yelland.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d had his ups an&rsquo; downs
like the best an&rsquo; worst of us; but though the poor old
gentleman weern&rsquo;t overblessed in his life,&mdash;nor yet
his only son for that matter,&mdash;yet &rsquo;twas made up to
him in a manner of speaking, for never a farm in Dartymoor did
better.&nbsp; His things were always the first to be ready for
market; his grass was always ready to cut a week ahead of his
neighbours, an&rsquo; he always had fine weather to cut it in;
while as for his corn an&rsquo; roots&mdash;why, at the
Agricultural Show to Ashburton, it comed to be a joke all over
the countryside, for first prize always went to Yelland as a
regular thing.&nbsp; The Lord looks after His own, you see, in
His own partickler way.&nbsp; An&rsquo; such a patient,
large-hearted man as he was!&nbsp; When Sarah Yelland, his wife,
was took off, after clacking nonsense for fifty year, us all
thanked God in our hearts for her good man.&nbsp; For
&rsquo;tweern&rsquo;t a happy marriage, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;d had
more to put up with unbeknownst <a name="page190"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 190</span>in his home circle than falls to the
lot of many of us.&nbsp; But not an unkind word did he ever say
either afore or after she died.&nbsp; Never would grumble about
it, but kept his thoughts to hisself.&nbsp; I mind I met him in
the churchyard six months after he&rsquo;d buried his wife,
an&rsquo; he was smoking his old clay pipe an&rsquo; seeing about
a granite gravestone for the tomb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So there her lies at peace,&rdquo; I said in my civil
way.</p>
<p>An&rsquo; farmer takes his pipe out of his mouth an&rsquo;
spits &rsquo;pon the grave, but not with any rude meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, John,&rdquo; he says to me.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
Sarah lies, poor old dear&mdash;at peace, I hope, I&rsquo;m
sure.&nbsp; Anyway, if she&rsquo;s so peaceful as I be since
her&rsquo;s gone, she&rsquo;ll do very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two year after that he was in the pit beside her, an&rsquo;
the space left &rsquo;pon the stone was filled up with his
vartues.</p>
<p>Then Nicholas Yelland&mdash;his son&mdash;a lad
five-an&rsquo;-twenty years old an&rsquo; a bit cross in the
grain&mdash;found hisself master of Cator Court, as the place was
called.&nbsp; We shook our heads, for he was known to us as a
chap pretty near spoilt by over-educating.&nbsp; Old Yelland had
got his patience an&rsquo; sense from the land, an&rsquo; his
wisdom an&rsquo; sweetness of disposition out of no other book
than the Bible; but his <a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>missis had great notions for her one
an&rsquo; only child, an&rsquo; she wanted more than the Bible
could teach him; which, in my judgement, is to cry out for better
bread than can be made of wheat.&nbsp; Farmering weern&rsquo;t a
grand enough trade for him, she thought; so she kept nagging
an&rsquo; nagging by day an&rsquo; night, till, in self-defence,
the old man sent his lad to Tavistock Grammar School&mdash;a very
great seat of larning in them days, by all accounts.&nbsp; Yet
what they didn&rsquo;t teach him was worth knowing too, for
manners he never larned, nor yet his duty to his neighbour.&nbsp;
He comed home at seventeen with some Latin, &rsquo;twas said,
though &rsquo;twas only rumoured like, an&rsquo; a very pretty
way of reading the lessons to church on Sundays; but when he
returned, the first thing as he told his faither was, &ldquo;I be
a Radical in politics evermore, an&rsquo; I ban&rsquo;t going to
touch my hat again to nobody living.&nbsp; One man&rsquo;s so
good as another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he be, Nick,&rdquo; said his faither.&nbsp;
&ldquo;An&rsquo; a darned sight better, too, for that
matter.&nbsp; The world will larn &rsquo;e that, if nothing
else.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry ever I sent &rsquo;e to school, if
they&rsquo;ve taught &rsquo;e such tomfoolery there.&nbsp; But
life will unlarn &rsquo;e, I hope.&nbsp; To touch your hat to
your betters ban&rsquo;t no sign of weakness in you, but a sign
of sense: Lord Luscombe hisself takes off his hat to the King,
an&rsquo; the King takes off his&rsquo;n to God
A&rsquo;mighty.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the <a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>laws of Nature,&rdquo; said farmer,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; if you break the laws o&rsquo; Nature,
you&rsquo;ll damn soon get broke yourself, as everybody finds out
after they&rsquo;m turned fifty, if not sooner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Yelland died, as I tell &rsquo;e, an&rsquo; the young man
comed to his own.&nbsp; With all his airs an&rsquo; graces, he
knowed when he was well off, an&rsquo; of course followed his
faither&rsquo;s footsteps an&rsquo; stuck to the land, despite
his mother&rsquo;s hopes, as planned an&rsquo; prayed with her
last breath for him to be a lawyer.&nbsp; Though why a lawyer
should be a greater man than a farmer, you&rsquo;d have to ax a
lawyer to tell &rsquo;e.&nbsp; An&rsquo; I won&rsquo;t say that
Nicholas was a bad farmer.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d got sense, though no
broad-mindedness.&nbsp; The difference between him an&rsquo; his
faither was showed by a path-field as ran through Cator Court
lands and was very much used by folks coming up from Widecombe to
Postbridge and the farms round about, because it saved
foot-passengers a good mile of walking, an&rsquo; it had been
there time out of mind.&nbsp; But there weren&rsquo;t no right of
way with it all the same, an&rsquo; farmer he always used to shut
it up one day a year to make good his claim in the eye of the
law.&nbsp; He wouldn&rsquo;t have turned back the leastest little
one he&rsquo;d found on the field-path, for &rsquo;twas his pride
an&rsquo; pleasure always to make life easier for man, woman
an&rsquo; child when the chance offered.&nbsp; An&rsquo; the boys
had the filbert nuts an&rsquo; the girls had the <a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>mushrooms;
an&rsquo; he never minded, bless you; he liked &rsquo;em to be
there.</p>
<p>Well, this here carmudgeon of a young Yelland&mdash;first
thing he done, out of pure sourness of disposition, was to shut
up the field-path an&rsquo; stick up a lot o&rsquo; scowling
nonsense &rsquo;bout &ldquo;trespassers would be
prosecuted.&rdquo;&nbsp; So much for his radical ideas an&rsquo;
everybody being equal!&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s always that sort who
talk loudest about the rights of men, be the sharpest about the
rights of property.&nbsp; Belted Earls will throw open their
beautiful parks, but you won&rsquo;t catch common men doing
it.&nbsp; An&rsquo; the boys knocked young Yelland&rsquo;s boards
down with stones, an&rsquo; broke his hedges; an&rsquo; the
Widecombe people, as didn&rsquo;t care a snap of the finger for
the man, took their even way as usual.&nbsp; He spent half his
time storming up an&rsquo; down the great meadow in the
farm-bottom, where Webburn river goes clattering to meet Dart;
but he only turned back women an&rsquo; children, for he was a
little chap&mdash;thin an&rsquo; not overstrong&mdash;so men just
told him to get out of their road, else they&rsquo;d knock him
upsy-edgeways into the hedge.</p>
<p>But of course such a state of things couldn&rsquo;t
last.&nbsp; There comed a terrible day when he turned back Mr.
Matthew&rsquo;s wife&mdash;Matthew being the miller to Widecombe
an&rsquo; a churchwarden, an&rsquo; a man of high renown in
general.&nbsp; Then us had a proper tantara, <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>an&rsquo;
Matthew he took the opinion of Lawyer Pearce, an&rsquo; Pearce he
had a tell with young Yelland, an&rsquo; parson Courtenay of
Postbridge, he also done what he could; which was nought.&nbsp;
They might so well have talked to a fuzz-bush as Nicholas.&nbsp;
He stuck out his chin&mdash;he was a underhung toad, like a
bulldog&mdash;and he said that rights was rights an&rsquo; land
was land; an&rsquo; he turned on parson, like an adder, and said:
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll open a footpath through your vegetable
garden an&rsquo; let all Postbridge walk up an&rsquo; down it
when your gooseberries be ripe, then I&rsquo;ll do the same with
my meadow, an&rsquo; not sooner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But parson, whose heart was in gooseberries, said the cases
weren&rsquo;t similar; an&rsquo; Nicholas held out they were.</p>
<p>Matters was let sink for a bit after that, but the upshot made
a story, an&rsquo; people laugh yet when you tell &rsquo;em about
it.</p>
<p>You must know that young Yelland was courting just then,
an&rsquo; he&rsquo;d got his hands so full with Mary Jane
Arscott, the stone-breaker&rsquo;s darter, that for lack of
leisure&mdash;nought else&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t watch his
path-field so sharp as usual.&nbsp; The storm died down a bit,
an&rsquo; by the time that the matter of Mary Jane had come to a
head, things were fallen back into the old way.&nbsp; All the
notice-boards was knocked down&mdash;most of &rsquo;em had
floated along the river; an&rsquo; the people went to an&rsquo;
fro on <a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>Yelland&rsquo;s path, just as if his faither was still
alive.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d only made a lot of enemies by his foolish
conduct, an&rsquo; that thought made him so grim as a ghost,
an&rsquo; poor company for every living soul.</p>
<p>Well, this Mary Jane was a very fine woman&mdash;rather on the
big side for a girl of twenty-two; but the small men always look
for a large, helpful pattern of maiden, an&rsquo; Nicholas was as
much in love with her as he could be with any mortal she, despite
her humble circumstances.&nbsp; Her liked him too, up to a
certain point; but &rsquo;twas the sort of fondness a maiden
naturally gets for any young man who be very well-to-do,
an&rsquo; have a fine house an&rsquo; land an&rsquo; a prosperous
business.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis hard to make up your mind about such a
man, specially if he&rsquo;m a trifle undersized an&rsquo;
underhung, an&rsquo; not generally well liked by the
neighbours.&nbsp; But, for all that, Mary Jane Arscott kept his
beautiful farm in her eye an&rsquo; seed her way pretty clear, if
it hadn&rsquo;t been for a young youth by the name of Benjamin
Pearn.&nbsp; But for him no doubt she&rsquo;d have said
&ldquo;yes&rdquo; long ago&mdash;perhaps afore Nicholas had had
time to get out his proposal of marriage, for she comed of very
pauper stock, an&rsquo; had never known comfort in her
life.&nbsp; But this here Ben Pearn chanced to have just what
t&rsquo;other man lacked&mdash;a comely countenance an&rsquo; a
fine, manly frame to him.&nbsp; A blue-eyed, sandy-headed
man&mdash;hard as nails an&rsquo; fairly <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>prosperous
for a chap only turned four or five-an&rsquo;-twenty.&nbsp; He
was a shepherd in springtime; an&rsquo; looked after the common
lands; an&rsquo; he was verger of the church; an&rsquo; he kept
bees; an&rsquo; he&rsquo;d lend a hand at thatching or painting
of sign-boards, or harvesting, or any mortal thing.&nbsp; But his
father had been a famous poacher, though of course I ban&rsquo;t
bringing that up against the man.&nbsp; Yet, with all his
cleverness, he was a fool when he failed in love, as a many afore
him.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas love for Mary Jane found out the soft spot
in him, an&rsquo; showed that he was a thought weak in his head,
for all his business, and could do an underhand deed, like
anybody else in the same fix.&nbsp; For when we&rsquo;m struck on
a maid, if us can&rsquo;t see how to fight fair in it, us all
fights foul without a blush.&nbsp; Which shows love ban&rsquo;t a
Bible vartue, but just a savage strain in the blood, if you come
to think of it.&nbsp; Besides, you can&rsquo;t forget his father
was a poacher.</p>
<p>Between these two men, Ben an&rsquo; Nicholas, it rested,
an&rsquo; Mary Jane took her time to make up her mind.&nbsp; She
was in love with Benjamin&rsquo;s self an&rsquo; Yelland&rsquo;s
farm.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s how it stood.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t
want to miss the farm, an&rsquo; she didn&rsquo;t want to miss
Benjamin; but her couldn&rsquo;t have both; an&rsquo; her found
it a bit difficult to make up her mind, though Lord He knows her
faither an&rsquo; mother done their best to make it up for
her.&nbsp; They had an eye <a name="page197"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>on the gert chimney-corners to Cator
Court, no doubt.</p>
<p>Then things happened that helped Mary Jane to decide.</p>
<p>The rights of it got out long after, but what took place was
this, for I heard it direct from Nicholas.&nbsp; Whatever else he
was, he was a truth-teller.&nbsp; One fine evening in late
summer, when Yelland was walking down his field-path in a devil
of a gale, because he found that folks had been breaking his
hedge again for the hazel-nuts an&rsquo; running all about the
meadow after mushrooms, there comed by Ben Pearn, an&rsquo; he
marked the trouble an&rsquo; spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a shame to see what you get for your
goodness in letting folks go up an&rsquo; down your field-path,
Mr. Yelland,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>But Nick looked at him sideways, for he knowed Ben was his
rival, an&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t feel like trusting him a yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t be here if I could help it.&nbsp;
But seemingly I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he answered back.</p>
<p>Ben nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The law won&rsquo;t help &rsquo;e?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a
crying shame; but if I was you, I&rsquo;d help myself an&rsquo;
hang the law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried often enough, surely.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
done every mortal thing that I can think of.&nbsp; I wish to God
us was allowed to use man-traps, like landowners did in the old
time.&nbsp; But the law&rsquo;s got so weak as water <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>nowadays.&nbsp; A man mayn&rsquo;t even shoot a
burglar, they tell me.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill be a penal offence next
to ax a housebreaker to leave the family Bible behind
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s man-traps an&rsquo;
man-traps.&nbsp; The meadow be yours to do what you please with,
ban&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; says Ben, very artful like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did ought to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can graze sheep in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or cattle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s that to do with the
matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might even let your great red Devon bull, as takes
so many prizes an&rsquo; have got such a douce an&rsquo; all of a
temper, run loose there, if you was minded
to&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Gor!&rdquo; said Nick Yelland.&nbsp; &ldquo;If that
ban&rsquo;t an idea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I judge you wouldn&rsquo;t have no more trouble then,
Nicholas.&nbsp; Better&rsquo;n notice-boards.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d
work quicker, too.&nbsp; One sight of him would be enough for
most people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the farmer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank
you very much.&nbsp; You&rsquo;m a quick-witted chap, for
sartain, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m greatly obliged to you.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll turn him in this very evening, an&rsquo; be damned to
everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An&rsquo; so he did, an&rsquo; next day that gert bull was <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>wallowing
in a pool o&rsquo; mud in the middle of the meadow an&rsquo;
wondering at his luck.</p>
<p>An&rsquo; when young Ben left Yelland he went straight down to
see Mary Jane Arscott.&nbsp; A crooked game he played, sure
enough!</p>
<p>They had a bit of love-making by the river, for she lived in a
cot down that way; an&rsquo; then Ben arranged to meet her next
day an&rsquo; go out upon Bellever Tor an&rsquo; pick
whortleberries.&nbsp; But he never said no word touching his talk
with Nicholas Yelland.</p>
<p>Well, the girl started pretty early from her mother&rsquo;s
cottage down the valley and came up as a matter of course over
the path-field past Cator Court; an&rsquo; for that matter,
Yelland had long since given her special permission to do
so.&nbsp; Her was halfway across the great meadow, with nothing
in her thoughts but mushrooms an&rsquo; whortleberries an&rsquo;
Benjamin Pearn, when there comed a sound very high-pitched
an&rsquo; ugly.&nbsp; It got louder an&rsquo; deeper till she
heard a proper bellow, an&rsquo; there, right ahead, she seed
Nick Yelland&rsquo;s great red Devon bull, a-pawing an&rsquo;
a-prancing as if he was trying to dance the sailor&rsquo;s
hornpipe.&nbsp; If he&rsquo;d been a thought farther off, no harm
could have come, for the path-way ran nigh the hedge; but as it
was, Mary Jane had a narrow squeak, for she&rsquo;d roamed a bit
to pick mushrooms, an&rsquo; when the old bull went for her,
she&rsquo;d got fifty <a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>yards to get to the hedge, an&rsquo;
he&rsquo;d got a bit more than a hundred to catch her.&nbsp; He
was in a good temper, I believe, an&rsquo; never really tried to
hurt her; but what&rsquo;s a joke to a bull may be mighty serious
earnest for a twelve-stone female.</p>
<p>She dropped her basket an&rsquo; ran for her life.&nbsp; She
weren&rsquo;t built for running, but nature will do a great deal,
even for the roundest of us, in a pinch like this, an&rsquo; for
once her got over the ground in very fine fashion.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;d reached within ten yards of the hedge, when she heard
a shout, an&rsquo; a man came tearing along; but he was too
late.&nbsp; Mary Jane went head first into the hazel hedge,
screaming to the Everlasting to spare her; an&rsquo; the
bull&rsquo;s horn just gave her the ghost of a touch&mdash;enough
to swear by after&mdash;as she went through, all ends up.&nbsp;
She weren&rsquo;t really hurt, an&rsquo; only took a chair a
thought gingerly for a day or two; but by God! her temper
didn&rsquo;t heal so easy, I promise you&mdash;not by no means;
an&rsquo; presently, when the man as had shouted an&rsquo; runned
to help her took the poor maiden home, she let him know what she
thought about the world in general an&rsquo; Nicholas Yelland in
particular, so soon as she had got wind enough to tell with.</p>
<p>Of course the man was Benjamin Pearn.&nbsp; An&rsquo; he
knowed really that the path-field ran nigh the hedge, an&rsquo;
he&rsquo;d been dead sure as Mary Jane would <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>not get
into no real danger.&nbsp; Besides, he had planned to be there in
plenty of time, an&rsquo; it wasn&rsquo;t till he actually seed
Mary Jane flying an&rsquo; the bull a-bellowing after her with
his tail up an&rsquo; his head down, that he knowed what
he&rsquo;d done.&nbsp; Then he rushed out from the hedge, where
he was hid, an&rsquo; thanked his stars in secret, for everything
had happened just ezacally as he wanted it to&mdash;though I
don&rsquo;t suppose he ever wished for the maiden to have such a
narrow shave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think!&rdquo; gasped Mary Jane.&nbsp; &ldquo;To
think as I might be a lifeless jelly this moment but for my own
legs!&nbsp; As &rsquo;tis, that gert beast&rsquo;s horn have
horched me somewheres, an&rsquo; I may die of it yet.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; if you&rsquo;m a man, Benjamin Pearn, you&rsquo;ll go
an&rsquo; get your gun an&rsquo; shutt him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s goodness! you don&rsquo;t mean Mr.
Yelland?&rdquo; said Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t; you can leave him to me,&rdquo; the
maiden answered; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have no living soul come
between me an&rsquo; Nicholas Yelland now.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll be
sorry as he was born afore his dinnertime, if I&rsquo;ve got a
tongue in my head; an&rsquo; he shall have all Postbridge hooting
at him in the open street&mdash;an&rsquo; Widecombe
too&mdash;come to-morrow.&nbsp; But &rsquo;tis your part to shutt
thicky beastly bull wi&rsquo; a gun; an&rsquo; if you love me,
you&rsquo;ll do it.&nbsp; He shan&rsquo;t take no more prizes, if
I can stop him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>&ldquo;As to shooting the bull, they&rsquo;d put me in
prison for it,&mdash;not that I&rsquo;d mind that if you&rsquo;d
have me when I comed out,&rdquo; said Ben, very eager like.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added as an after-thought, &ldquo;the
dashed luck of it is, I haven&rsquo;t got a gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her black eyes flashed an&rsquo; her gipsy-dark face growed
darker still.&nbsp; She still panted an&rsquo; puffed a
bit.&nbsp; But Ben confessed arter that she never looked so
lovely afore or since as she did when he pulled her out of the
brambles in the hedge an&rsquo; comforted her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d best to borrow a gun, then,&rdquo; she told
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Anyway, I won&rsquo;t marry you while that
bull&rsquo;s alive; an&rsquo; if you was a man, you&rsquo;d never
sleep again till you&rsquo;d put a bullet through it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Same afternoon she went up with her mother to Cator Court
an&rsquo; gave Nicholas Yelland the whole law an&rsquo; the
prophets, by all accounts.&nbsp; I seem his ears must have
tingled to hear her; but he was a pretty cool hand; an&rsquo;
when she&rsquo;d talked herself out of breath an&rsquo; falled
back on torrents an&rsquo; oceans of tears; an&rsquo; when her
mother had also said what she comed to say, which was mere
tinkling brass after Mary Jane, Nick popped in a word or two
edgeways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll be so very kind as to hold your noise a
minute,&mdash;the pair of you,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell you how the
bull got in the field,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t my idea at all.&nbsp; Ben Pearn put
me up to it.&nbsp; So you&rsquo;ve got <a

him, not me.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know as you was coming that way
to-day, God&rsquo;s my Judge, or I&rsquo;d have been at the stile
to meet you an&rsquo; see you over the meadow safe; but Pearn
knowed you was coming, an&rsquo; any fool can see that he wanted
to kill you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He axed me to come,&rdquo; said Mary Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he?&nbsp; Then &rsquo;tis him you&rsquo;ve got to
thank, not me.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis only by the mercy of Heaven he
ban&rsquo;t a murderer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better look after him, then,&rdquo; said
Mary Jane, thoughtful like, &ldquo;for I&rsquo;ve told un to kill
your bull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let un,&rdquo; answered Nicholas, very cunning.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a good mind to shoot the old devil myself for
daring to run after you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Mrs. Arscott struck the iron while it was hot, an&rsquo;
afore she left that farm parlour, Mary Jane had named the
day!</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas rather a funny case of a chap over-reaching
himself in a love affair.&nbsp; You see, Ben Pearn was so blessed
soft-headed, that he couldn&rsquo;t look on to the end of the
game like any cleverer man might.&nbsp; He said to his silly
self, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll make her hate the chap, so she&rsquo;d
like to scratch his eyes out&rsquo;; but he never seed that the
end must be differ&rsquo;nt; he never remembered that Nicholas
Yelland had a tongue in his head same as other people.</p>
<p><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>So
Ben was sent off with a flea in his ear, an&rsquo; the world
laughed at him, an&rsquo; he changed his opinion about marriage
an&rsquo; growed to be a hard an&rsquo; fast bachelor, an&rsquo;
a very great lover of saving money.&nbsp; But as for Mary Jane,
she did her husband a power of good an&rsquo; enlarged his mind
every way.&nbsp; An&rsquo; when they got a family, young
Yelland&rsquo;s nature comed very well through the usual ups
an&rsquo; downs of life.&nbsp; He fancied hisself less, an&rsquo;
thought of his little people an&rsquo; his good lady first,
an&rsquo; growed a bit more like his faither before him.&nbsp;
Not, of course, that he was the man his faither was.&nbsp; But
what chap ever be, for that matter?&nbsp; I never see none.</p>

207</span>CHAPTER I</h3>
<p>There is a desolation that no natural scene has power to
invoke.&nbsp; The labour of Nature&rsquo;s thousand forces upon
earth&rsquo;s face may awaken awe before their enduring record,
but can conjure no sense of sorrow; for high mountains, huge
waste places and rivers calling shall make us feel small enough,
not sad; but cast into the vast theatre some stone that marks a
man&rsquo;s grave, some ruined aboriginal hut or roofless
cottage, some hyp&aelig;thral meeting-place or arena of deserted
human activity, and emotions rise to accentuate the scene.&nbsp;
Henceforth the desert is peopled with ghosts of men and women;
and their hopes and ambitions, their triumphs, and griefs glimmer
out of dream pictures and tune the beholder to a sentiment of
mournfulness.</p>
<p>Such a scene on a scale unusually spacious may be found in the
central waste of Dartmoor, nigh Postbridge.&nbsp; Here, where
marshes stretch, all ribbed with black peat cuttings, between the
arms of Dart, where Higher White Tor rises northward <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>and the
jagged summits of lesser peaks slope southerly to Crockern, there
lies a strange congeries of modern buildings rotting into dust
and rust at the song of a stream.&nbsp; Even the lonely groves
that shield these ruins are similarly passing to decay; but many
trees still flourish there, and under the shadows of them, or
upon the banks of the Cherry-brook that winds in the midst and
babbles its way to the mother-river, stand scattered remains of a
considerable factory.&nbsp; Now only a snipe drums or a plover
mews plaintively, where some short years ago was great hum and
stir of business and a colony of men engaged upon most dangerous
toil.&nbsp; Rows of whitewashed buildings still peep from the
dark grove or stud those undulating hillocks that tend moorward
beyond it.&nbsp; Tall grey chimneys rise here and there, and
between certain shattered buildings, linking the same together,
great water-wheels appear.&nbsp; These from their deep abodes
thrust forth shattered spokes and crooked limbs and claws.&nbsp;
They slumber half in gloom, like fossil monsters partially
revealed.&nbsp; From their dilapidated jaws there glitters the
slime of unclean creatures; moss hides the masses of their
putrefied bones; huge liverworts clothe their decay, and
hart&rsquo;s-tongue ferns loll from their cracks and clefts, and
thrive in the eternal twilight beneath them.&nbsp; Once twin
pairs of grinders turned here, and the last aspect of these is
even more <a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>uncouth than that of the water-wheels that drove
them.&nbsp; Their roofs are blown away and the rollers beneath
are cased in rust and moss.&nbsp; Willows and grasses and the
flowers of the waste flourish above their ruins; broom, dock,
rush, choke the old watercourses; crowfoot mantles the stagnant
pools that remain; and all is chaos, wreck and collapse.&nbsp;
For here spreads the scene of a human failure, the grave of an
unsuccessful enterprise.&nbsp; Its secret may still be read in
dank strips of old proclamations hanging upon notice-boards
within the ruins, and telling that men made gunpowder here; but
those precautions necessary to establish the factory upon a site
remote from any populous district indirectly achieved its ruin,
for profits were swallowed by the cost of carriage from a
situation so inaccessible.</p>
<p>At gloaming of an autumn day one living thing only moved amid
the old powder-mills, and he felt no emotion in presence of that
scene, for it was the playground of his life; his eyes had opened
within a few score yards of it.&nbsp; Young David Daccombe knew
every hole and corner of the various workshops, and had his own
different goblin names for the quaint tools still lumbering many
a rotting floor, and the massive machinery, left as not worth
cost of removal.&nbsp; Mystery lurked in countless dark recesses,
and Davey had made secret discoveries too and was lord of
tremendous, treasured wonders <a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>hidden within the labyrinths of
these crumbling mills.</p>
<p>But at this moment all things were forgotten before a supreme
and new experience.&nbsp; The boy had just caught his first
trout, and a little fingerling fish now flapped and gasped out
its life under his admiring eyes.&nbsp; Davey was a plain child,
with a narrow brow and hard mouth.&nbsp; Now he smelt the trout,
patted it, chuckled over his capture, then casting down an osier
rod, with its hook and a disgorged worm halfway up the gut, he
prepared to rush home and display his triumph to his
mother.&nbsp; As he climbed up from the stream and reached a
little bridge that crossed it, his small face puckered into a
fear, for he heard himself called harshly, knew the voice and
felt little love for the speaker.</p>
<p>Out of the deepening gloom under the fir trees a young man
appeared with a gun under his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be that you, Davey, an&rsquo; did I see a rod?&nbsp; If
so, I&rsquo;ll break it in pieces, I warn &rsquo;e.&nbsp;
Fishin&rsquo; season ended last Saturday, an&rsquo; here&rsquo;s
the keeper&rsquo;s awn brother poachin&rsquo;.&nbsp; A nice
thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dick!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve catched one!&nbsp; First
ever I really catched.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t mother be brave
an&rsquo; glad to eat un?&nbsp; Ban&rsquo;t very big, but a real
trout.&nbsp; I be just takin&rsquo; it home-along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do no such thing, you little rascal.&nbsp;
Give it to me this instant moment, or else I&rsquo;ll make
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>Richard Daccombe approached and towered over his
brother.&nbsp; It was easy to see that they were near of kin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Dick&mdash;just this wance&mdash;&rsquo;tis
awnly a li&rsquo;l tiny feesh&mdash;first ever I took, too.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; I swear I&rsquo;ll not feesh no more&mdash;honour
bright.&nbsp; Please&mdash;for mother never won&rsquo;t believe I
ackshually catched one if her doan&rsquo;t see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it to me, or I&rsquo;ll take it, I tell you, you
dirty little thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davey&rsquo;s lip went down.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a damn,
cruel shame.&nbsp; You&rsquo;m always against me.&nbsp; I wish
you was dead, I do.&nbsp; I never knawed no chap in all my days
what have got such a beast of a brother as I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give up that feesh, else I&rsquo;ll throw you in the
river, you lazy li&rsquo;l good-for-nought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;m a gert bully,&rdquo; began the boy; then he
fell upon a happy thought, and braced himself to sacrifice his
most treasured secret.&nbsp; To let it go into his
brother&rsquo;s keeping was bad, but anything seemed better than
that his first trout should be lost to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look &rsquo;e here, Richard,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;will &rsquo;e let me keep this feesh if I tell &rsquo;e
something terrible coorious &rsquo;bout these auld
mills?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The keeper laughed sourly.&nbsp; &ldquo;A lot more you&rsquo;m
likely to knaw &rsquo;bout &rsquo;em than I do!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>&ldquo;Ess fay, I do.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a wonnerful
secret as I found out all to myself, an&rsquo; never yet told to
a single soul.&nbsp; It comes in my games&mdash;my Robinson
Crusoe game; but I never play that wi&rsquo; any other
chap&mdash;not even they boys from Postbridge.&nbsp; I be the
only living soul as knaws; an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll tell you if
you&rsquo;ll let me keep my feesh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this &rsquo;mazin&rsquo; secret,
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll swear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ess, if the thing be any good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&nbsp; I should just reckon &rsquo;twas
good.&nbsp; Come an&rsquo; see for yourself&mdash;I was awful
&rsquo;feared at first.&nbsp; Now I doan&rsquo;t care
nothin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; many a time I&rsquo;ve took a gert
handful an&rsquo; lighted it, an&rsquo; seen it go off
&lsquo;pouf&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led the way to a low building with a dull red roof.&nbsp;
It was windowless, but had a door that swung at the will of the
wind.&nbsp; This erection was lined inside with matchboarding,
and it contained a board of regulations that prohibited all metal
within the shed.&nbsp; Even a nail in a boot was unlawful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis Case House No. 4.&mdash;used once for
storing powder,&rdquo; said Richard Daccombe; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
a pile of sulphur in the corner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ess, but theer&rsquo;s mor&rsquo;n you can see,
Dick.&nbsp; Look here.&nbsp; Another floor lies under this,
though nobody minded that, I reckon, else they&rsquo;d have took
what&rsquo;s theer.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>Davey
moved two boards, and beneath them&mdash;dry and sound as when
there deposited&mdash;he revealed some tons of black blasting
powder.&nbsp; His brother started, swore in sudden concern,
hastened from the building, and, taking his pipe out of his
mouth, carefully extinguished it.&nbsp; Then he returned and
accosted Davey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me about this before, you
little fool?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why for should I?&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas my gert
secret.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;ll not let it out, will you,
Dick?&nbsp; If chaps comed to hear, they&rsquo;d steal every
atom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This Richard knew very well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be dumb, and mind that you are,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;And no more playing games with
gunpowder.&nbsp; You might have blowed the whole countryside to
glory.&nbsp; Keep away in future.&nbsp; If I catch you within a
hunderd yards of this place, I&rsquo;ll lather you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finding be keeping,&rdquo; answered Davey,
indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps &rsquo;tis; an&rsquo; might be right.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve heard me.&nbsp; That powder&rsquo;s mine
henceforth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davey knew his brother pretty well, but such injustice made
him gasp.&nbsp; His small brains worked quickly, and remembering
that Richard&rsquo;s business on the rabbit warren took him far
from the powder-mills, the boy held his peace.</p>
<p>This silence, however, angered the bully more <a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>than
words.&nbsp; They moved homeward together, and the elder spoke
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you can just fork out that trout, and be quick
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You promised on your honour!&rdquo; cried Davey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Promises doan&rsquo;t hold wi&rsquo;
poachers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were walking from the valley to their home; and the
younger, seeing the farm-house door not two hundred yards
distant, made a sudden bolt in hope to reach his mother and
safety before Dick could overtake him.&nbsp; But he was soon
caught and violently flung to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you, you whelp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A blow upon the side of the head dazed the child, and before
he could recover or resist, his brother had thrust a rough hand
into Davey&rsquo;s pocket, dragged therefrom the little trout,
and stamped it to pulp under his heel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&mdash;now you go home-along in front of me, you
young dog.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll teach you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy stood up, muddy, dishevelled, shaking with rage.&nbsp;
His eyes shone redly in the setting sunlight; he clenched his
little fists, and his frame shook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he said slowly, with passion strong enough
for the moment to arrest his tears.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wait till I be
grawed up.&nbsp; Then &rsquo;twill be my turn, an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;ll do &rsquo;e all the ill ever I can.&nbsp; You&rsquo;m
a cowardly, <a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>cruel devil to me always, an&rsquo; I swear I&rsquo;ll
pay you back first instant I be strong enough to do
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get in the house an&rsquo; shut your rabbit-mouth, or
I&rsquo;ll give &rsquo;e something to swear for,&rdquo; answered
the keeper.</p>
<p>Then his great loss settled heavily upon Davey&rsquo;s soul,
and he wept and went home to his mother.</p>
<h3><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>CHAPTER II</h3>
<p>Richard Daccombe visited the little bridge over Cherry-brook
yet again after his supper; and in a different mood, beside a
different companion, he sat upon the granite parapet.&nbsp;
Darkness, fretted with white moonlight, was under the fir trees;
the Moor stretched dimly to the hills in one wan featureless
waste; an owl cried from the wood, and one shattered chimney
towered ghostly grey over the desolation.&nbsp; Quaint black
ruins, like hump-backed giants, dotted the immediate distance,
and the river twinkled and murmured under the moon, while
Dick&rsquo;s pipe glowed, and a girl&rsquo;s voice sounded at his
elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sweetheart,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;why be you so hard
with Davey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave that, Jane,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis mother has been at you&mdash;as if I
didn&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; Little twoad&rsquo;s all the better for
licking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s so small, and you&rsquo;m so big.&nbsp; He
do hate you cruel, an&rsquo; your mother&rsquo;s sore driven
between you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s soft.&nbsp; The child would grow up a
dolt if &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>&ldquo;Yet you had no brother to wallop you,
Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faither was there, wasn&rsquo;t he?&nbsp; I call to
mind his heavy hand, and always shall.&nbsp; But if you mean I be
a dolt, say it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Us all knaw you&rsquo;m cleverest man this side of
Plymouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop it, then, an&rsquo; tell of something
different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane Stanberry did as she was bid: her arms went round
Dick&rsquo;s neck, and her lips were pressed against his
face.&nbsp; To the girl he represented her greatest
experience.&nbsp; Orphaned as a tender child, she had come to
Cross Ways farm, in the lonely valley of the powder-mills, and
there dwelt henceforth with her mother&rsquo;s kinswoman, Mary
Daccombe.</p>
<p>The establishment was small, and a larger company had not
found means to subsist upon the hungry new-takes and scanty
pasture-lands of Cross Ways.&nbsp; Jonathan Daccombe and his
wife, with two hinds, here pursued the hard business of
living.&nbsp; Richard was in private service as keeper of White
Tor rabbit warren, distant a few miles from his home; and he
divided his time between the farm and a little hut of a single
chamber, perched in the lonely scene of his labour.&nbsp; Of
other children the Daccombes had none living save Davey, though
two daughters and another son had entered into life at Cross
Ways, pined through brief years there, and so departed.&nbsp; The
churchyard, as Jonathan <a name="page218"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 218</span>Daccombe frankly declared, had been
a good friend to him.</p>
<p>Jane was a deep-breasted, rough-haired girl of eighteen.&nbsp;
She possessed pale blue eyes, a general large-featured
comeliness, and a nature that took life without complaining; and
she held herself much blessed in the affection of her cousin
Richard.&nbsp; Talk of marriage for them was in the air, but it
depended upon an increase of wages for Dick, and his master
seemed little disposed to generosity.</p>
<p>The bridge by night was a favourite meeting and parting place
for the lovers, because young Daccombe&rsquo;s work in late
autumn took him much upon the Moor after dark.&nbsp; The time of
trapping was come, and his copper wires glimmered by the hundred
along those faintly marked rabbit runs, familiar to experienced
eyes alone.&nbsp; These he tended from dusk till dawn, and slept
between the intervals of his labour within the little hut already
mentioned.</p>
<p>A topic more entertaining than the child Davey now arose; and
Jane, whose spirit was romantic, with a sort of romance not bred
of her wild home, speculated upon an approaching event that
promised some escape from the daily monotony of life at Cross
Ways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow he&rsquo;ll actually come,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve put the finishing touches to his
room to-day.&nbsp; What will he be like, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>&ldquo;I mind the chap a few years back-along playing
foot-ball to Tavistock.&nbsp; A well-set-up youth, &rsquo;bout my
size, or maybe bigger in the bone.&nbsp; An&rsquo; he could play
foot-ball, no doubt.&nbsp; In fact, a great hand at sporting of
all sorts; but work&mdash;not likely!&nbsp; Why for should
he?&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll have oceans of money when his faither
dies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother reckons &rsquo;tis all moonshine
&rsquo;bout his coming to Cross Ways to learn farming.&nbsp; She
says that he&rsquo;m sent here to keep him out of
mischief&mdash;for same reason as powder-mills was sent
here.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll ride about, an&rsquo; hunt, an&rsquo;
shoot, for sartain.&nbsp; But he won&rsquo;t never take sensible
to work&mdash;so your mother reckons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he won&rsquo;t; but faither be going to get two
pound a week by him; so what he does ban&rsquo;t no great odds,
so long as he bides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you call him a gen&rsquo;leman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentle is as gentle does.&nbsp; Us shall
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wi&rsquo; book-larnin&rsquo;, no doubt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little enough, I fancy.&nbsp; Nought but a fool goes
farmin&rsquo; in these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet &rsquo;tis our hope, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo;
objected Jane.&nbsp; &ldquo;Please God, Dick, us will be able to
take a little farm down in the country some day&mdash;won&rsquo;t
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the country&mdash;yes; but not &rsquo;pon this
wilderness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was silence between them again, while the <a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>owl hooted
and the river scattered silver in the rushes and babbled against
the granite bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what colour the chap&rsquo;s eyes be,
Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be black if I hear much more about
him,&rdquo; he answered shortly.&nbsp; &ldquo;For I&rsquo;ll
darken both first day he comes here&mdash;just to show how we
stand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re jealous afore you&rsquo;ve seed
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; you&rsquo;re a blamed sight too hungry to see
him.&nbsp; Best drop him.&nbsp; He won&rsquo;t be nought to you,
I s&rsquo;pose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you be so sharp, Dick?&nbsp; Ban&rsquo;t it
natural a gal what leads such a wisht life as me should think
twice of a new face&mdash;an&rsquo; a gen&rsquo;leman,
too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anthony Maybridge have got one enemy afore he shows his
nose here; and you&rsquo;re to thank for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then I know what to expect when
we&rsquo;m married, I s&rsquo;pose.&nbsp; But no call for you to
be afeared!&nbsp; If he was so butivul as Angel Gabriel
he&rsquo;d be nought to me.&nbsp; Kiss me same as I kissed you
just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Dick was troubled.&nbsp; His clay pipe also drew ill, and
he dashed it into the water.&nbsp; &ldquo;Damn kissing!&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick of it.&nbsp; Get home, an&rsquo; let
me go to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young man will like you better than me, when
all&rsquo;s said, dear heart; for you&rsquo;ll give him best
sport of anybody in these parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He grunted, and left her without more words; <a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>while she,
familiar with his sulky moods, showed no particular regret.&nbsp;
To the hills he strode away, and the misty marshes swallowed up
sight of him, while he threaded his road through the bogs,
climbed great stony slopes under the hilltop, and reached his
warren.&nbsp; But bad fortune stuck close to Richard that night,
for of two fine rabbits snared since sundown, nothing remained
but the heads.</p>
<p>Foxes, however, are sacred upon Dartmoor, even in the warrens;
though, if evil language could have hurt them, it must have gone
ill with a vixen and five brave cubs, whose home was hard by in
the granite bosom of White Tor.</p>
<h3><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>CHAPTER III</h3>
<p>Anthony Maybridge arrived at Cross Ways, and amongst the
various items of his luggage he was only concerned for his
gun-case.&nbsp; Mrs. Daccombe greeted the youth with old-time
courtesy, and her husband soon perceived that the newcomer would
be a pupil in little more than name.&nbsp; Anthony, indeed, made
an energetic start, and for the space of a full week resolutely
dogged the farmer&rsquo;s footsteps; but his enterprise sprang
from a whim rather than a fixed enthusiasm.&nbsp; On the spur of
the moment, before various alternatives, he had decided upon
farming; but the impulse toward that life waned, and in a month
the lad found Richard Daccombe&rsquo;s society much more
congenial than that of his taciturn parent.&nbsp; Good store of
snipe and plover were now upon the Moor, and they drew young
Maybridge more surely than the business of manuring hay lands or
getting in the mangel-wurzel crop.&nbsp; With Dick, indeed, he
struck into close fellowship, founded on the basis of the gun;
and with Jane Stanberry he also became more friendly than anybody
but herself was aware.&nbsp; Socially, Maybridge stood separated
from his host by the accident of success alone.&nbsp; <a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>Daccombe
and Anthony&rsquo;s father were old acquaintances, and the
latter, a prosperous nurseryman at Tavistock, sometimes fell in
with his friend when the hounds met at the powder-mills.</p>
<p>The boy found Jane sympathetic, and being possessed of a warm
heart but little sense, he soon revealed to her the true cause of
his present life and temporary banishment from home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can believe it,&rdquo; he said, when she met him
returning from a day with the snipe in the bogs,&mdash;&ldquo;if
you can believe it, I shall be surprised.&nbsp; I always thought
a man ought to look up to women as the soul of truth and all
that.&nbsp; I was engaged&mdash;secretly; and there was another
chap I hardly knew by sight even; and that girl was playing with
me&mdash;like you play with a hooked fish; the only difference
being she didn&rsquo;t want to land me.&nbsp; In fact, I was the
bait, if you understand such a blackguard thing, and she fished
with me and caught the other chap.&nbsp; I could mention names,
but what&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How horrid!&rdquo; said Jane.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sure I&rsquo;d very much rather not know who
&rsquo;twas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway, the other chap took the bait.&nbsp; And
the moment she got him she threw me over.&nbsp; <i>After we were
engaged</i>, mind you!&nbsp; And the rum thing is, looking at it
from a mere worldly point of view, that I shall be worth tons
more money than that chap ever will be.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t really care about you,
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose not, though I would have taken my dying oath
she did.&nbsp; And after the frightful blow of being chucked, I
tried to hide the effect, but couldn&rsquo;t, owing to going
right off my feed&mdash;especially breakfasts.&nbsp; My mother
spotted that, and taxed me with being ill&mdash;a thing I never
have been in my life.&nbsp; So I had to confess to her what a
frightful trial I&rsquo;d been through, and she told the
governor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they must have been very sad about it,
for your sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not half as much as you would have thought; though many
chaps have been utterly smashed up body and soul and gone into a
consumption of the lungs for less.&nbsp; But it came as a bit of
a shock to my people, because, you see, I&rsquo;d never mentioned
it, and&mdash;well, the girl was in a tobacconist&rsquo;s shop,
and my governor hates tobacco; which made it worse, though very
unfair it should.&nbsp; Anyway, it shows what girls
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And shows what fathers are, seemingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; though how my governor, whose grandfather himself
went out working in other people&rsquo;s gardens, could object to
a girl who had pluck enough to earn her own living, I don&rsquo;t
know.&nbsp; I had a furious row about it, until he pointed out
that, as she had chucked me, it was not much good quarrelling
with him about her.&nbsp; Which was true.&nbsp; Nobody <a
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>but you has
really understood what a knock-down thing it was.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
an atheist now&mdash;simply owing to that woman; I don&rsquo;t
believe in a single thing.&nbsp; I said all girls were the same
till I met you.&nbsp; Still, I feel as bitter as a lemon when I
think much about it.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;re different, I can see
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll feel happier come presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am happier already&mdash;in a way, because I find all
women are not like that.&nbsp; You and Mrs. Daccombe have done me
a lot of good, especially you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I be gay and proud to think so,&rdquo; said
Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To promise and then change!&nbsp; Why, it&rsquo;s
contrary to human nature, I should think,&rdquo; declared the
ingenuous Anthony.&nbsp; But Jane Stanberry did not reply; she
had reached a point in her own experience of life that indicated
the possibility of such a circumstance.</p>
<p>Young Maybridge was pleasant to see, and, as cynical chance
would have it, his gifts, both physical and mental, were of a
sort to shine conspicuous from the only contrast at hand.&nbsp;
Dick Daccombe had a face of true Celtic cast, that might have
been handsome, but was spoiled by an expression generally surly
and always mean.&nbsp; His character became more distrustful and
aggressive as he grew older, and the suspicious nature of him
looked specially ill before Anthony&rsquo;s frankness and
simplicity.&nbsp; The latter was fair, with open, Saxon type of
<a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>countenance.&nbsp; His good temper overcame all
Richard&rsquo;s jealousy from the first, but the keeper envied
Anthony&rsquo;s extra inch and a half of height and greater
weight of shoulder, though he himself was the closer knit of the
two.</p>
<p>For a period of weeks all went well between the young men, and
their increasing intimacy argued ill for Anthony&rsquo;s progress
toward practical knowledge in agriculture.&nbsp; This Jonathan
Daccombe understood, but held it no concern of his.&nbsp; It
happened that the farmer came home one day just in time to see
his son and his pupil departing from Cross Ways together.&nbsp;
An expression of contempt touched with slight amusement lighted
his grey face, and he turned to Jane Stanberry, who stood at the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like the seed &rsquo;pon stony ground,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Comed up wi&rsquo; a fine blade an&rsquo; full
o&rsquo; nature, then withered away, &rsquo;cause there
wasn&rsquo;t no good holding stuff behind.&nbsp; A farmer!&nbsp;
However, there&rsquo;s no call he should be.&nbsp; He&rsquo;m
here to learn to forget, not to farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is forgetting so fast as he can,&rdquo; declared the
girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got nought to say nowadays
&rsquo;bout the wickedness of women and such-like; an&rsquo; he
went to church wi&rsquo; mother an&rsquo; me &rsquo;essterday to
Postbridge, an&rsquo; singed the psalms an&rsquo; hymns wi&rsquo;
a fine appetite, I&rsquo;m sure.&nbsp; His voice be so deep as a
cow when he uplifts it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>&ldquo;I reckon he&rsquo;m getting over his trouble too
quick for my liking,&rdquo; answered Mr. Daccombe.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My bird will be off some fine mornin&rsquo; when shooting
be over and theer&rsquo;s nought more for him to kill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meantime, while Jane spoke with admiration of Anthony&rsquo;s
good qualities, and Mrs. Daccombe heard her indignantly, young
Maybridge himself was similarly angering another member of the
Daccombe family.&nbsp; Now he stood with Dick upon the lofty
crown of Higher White Tor, and watched a flock of golden plover
newly come to their winter quarters from some northern
home.&nbsp; They flew and cried at a great height above the
marshes, wheeled and warped in the clear blue of a December sky;
and when simultaneously they turned, there was a flash as of a
hundred little stars, where the sunlight touched the plumage of
their breasts and under-wings.&nbsp; But they were bound for a
region beyond the range of the sportsmen who watched them; soon,
indeed, the birds dwindled into dots, that made a great &gt; upon
the sky; and as they flew, they constantly renewed that
figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pity,&rdquo; said Anthony.&nbsp; &ldquo;Off to the
middle of the Moor.&nbsp; Haven&rsquo;t got a shot at a golden
plover yet.&nbsp; Miss Jane&rsquo;s favourite bird, too, so she
says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No call for you to trouble about that.&nbsp; If she
eats all I&rsquo;ve shot for her, she&rsquo;ll do very
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a lucky devil, Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
228</span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as may be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always the way with chaps like you, who never had
anything to do but ask and get &lsquo;yes&rsquo; for an
answer.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know when you&rsquo;re well off in
these parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard laughed without much merriment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s so good fish in the sea as ever come out
of it,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d not break my heart
for any girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A chap in love to say such a cold-blooded
thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not all froth and splutter, like
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor yet ice, like you, I should hope.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re engaged to the prettiest girl I&rsquo;ve ever seen
in my life, and the best; and you take it as if it was your right
instead of your frightfully good luck.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s only
because you don&rsquo;t know the world that you are so infernally
complacent about her, Richard.&nbsp; If you knew all that I
do&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other sneered in a tone of levity.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
wonnerful lady&rsquo;s man you&mdash;by all accounts!&nbsp; But
don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m afeared of you.&nbsp; Might have been
jealous afore you comed&mdash;not since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anthony grew red as the dead asphodel foliage under his feet
in the bogs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as much as to say I&rsquo;m a
fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s as much as to say you&rsquo;re
honest&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t what you meant when you spoke.&nbsp;
<a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>You were
laughing because you know you are sharper than I am.&nbsp; You
may be, but you&rsquo;re not sharp enough to know your
luck.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve told me pretty plainly what I am; now
I&rsquo;ll tell you what you are&mdash;a good shot and a good
sportsman all round, but no other good that I can see.&nbsp; You
think a jolly sight too much of yourself to make a good husband,
anyway.&nbsp; If Jane realised&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind your awn business!&rdquo; thundered out the other,
&ldquo;and keep her name off your tongue henceforward.&nbsp;
D&rsquo;you think I doan&rsquo;t know her a million times better
than you do?&nbsp; D&rsquo;you think us wants lessons from you
after all these years, you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can make you angry, then, though I am a born
fool?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you can; an&rsquo; you damn soon will if
you&rsquo;m not more careful of your speech.&nbsp; I doan&rsquo;t
want to take law in my own hands an&rsquo; give you a thrashing;
but that&rsquo;ll I do if you touch this matter again.&nbsp; Who
are you, to tell me my duty to my maiden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to what you&rsquo;ll do or won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo;
answered Maybridge, growing very rosy again, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
two sides to that.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d have asked you to box weeks
ago, only I&rsquo;m taller and heavier, and I thought you would
think it unsportsmanlike.&nbsp; But now&mdash;when you
please.&nbsp; As for Miss Jane, I shall speak to her, and see
her, and go to church with her just as often <a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>as
she&rsquo;ll let me, without asking leave from you or
anybody.&nbsp; So now you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anthony swung off over the Moor, and Richard, pursuing the way
to his hut on the shoulder of the tor, let the other depart
unanswered.&nbsp; This sudden and unexpected breach rather
pleased the keeper.&nbsp; He had always held Anthony to be a
fool, and the fact seemed now proved beyond further
dispute.&nbsp; It was not until he had lived through the
loneliness of a long day and night upon the warren that the young
man viewed his situation differently.&nbsp; Then three
harpies&mdash;wrath, resentment and a natural
jealousy&mdash;sprang full-fledged into being, and drove him home
before them.</p>
<p>As for Maybridge, smarting under a sense of insult and a worse
sense that he deserved it, the young man strove to excuse himself
to his conscience.&nbsp; He assured himself many times that
Richard Daccombe was unworthy of Jane Stanberry in every possible
respect.&nbsp; And there came a day when he told her that he
thought so.</p>
<h3><a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<p>Mary Daccombe was wont to reserve the problems of the working
day until nightfall; and her husband solved them as best he could
during those brief minutes that intervened between the extinction
of the candle and his first snore.&nbsp; An honest but
unsentimental man, love for his offspring had never particularly
marked his mind.&nbsp; He was contented that his sons should
quarrel, and that Dick should thrash Davey when he felt so
disposed, for it saved him the trouble.&nbsp; He held that each
did the other good, and he had neither pity nor particular regard
to spare for either.</p>
<p>This cheerless fact now appeared, for on a night soon after
Christmas, Mrs. Daccombe approached her husband upon a matter of
sentiment, and won colder comfort from him than she
expected.&nbsp; He gave her an obvious opportunity to approach
the subject, otherwise it is doubtful whether she would have had
the courage to do so.&nbsp; That day, to the farmer&rsquo;s
astonishment and gratification, Anthony Maybridge had come back
from a brief Christmas vacation.&nbsp; The holiday extended over
a fortnight, and Daccombe fully believed that he had seen the <a
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>last of his
pupil; but Anthony returned, declared a renewed interest in
matters agricultural, and gave the farmer to understand that he
should continue to reside at Cross Ways for the present.</p>
<p>Now Jonathan laughed as he stretched himself on his bed; he
laughed, and wondered what had brought young Maybridge again to
the Moor.&nbsp; Whereupon his wife read him the riddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not you, nor yet the work, nor yet the shooting,&rdquo;
she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis right as you should know,
however, for trouble&rsquo;s brewing, if I can see, an&rsquo;
&rsquo;tis our awn son will smart for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Us have all got to smart off an&rsquo; on, though how
that moon-calf of a boy be going to hurt Dick or Davey, I
can&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Davey, though &rsquo;twas him as found it out, I
reckon.&nbsp; Davey be venomous against his brother&mdash;always
was, worse luck.&nbsp; Dick rubs it into the bwoy, and his
brother hurts him with bitter mouth-speech when he can.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis this way: that young gen&rsquo;leman be getting a deal
too fond of Jane Stanberry by the looks of it.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
what he&rsquo;s comed back for, I reckon.&nbsp; Davey spat it out
essterday when Dick clouted his head.&nbsp; Her wasn&rsquo;t
theer, so the boy up an&rsquo; said as Dick&rsquo;s temper would
weary the Dowl, an&rsquo; that Jane was looking away from him to
a better.&nbsp; Lucky I was by, else Dick would have done the
li&rsquo;l un a mischief.&nbsp; He growed thunder-black, yet <a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>I could see
by his wrath be knowed the tale were more than Davey&rsquo;s
spite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them two takes after your family, mother, an&rsquo; no
mistake.&nbsp; Yet I hope they won&rsquo;t turn gaol-birds, or
else weak in their intellects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman felt the tears in her weary eyes.&nbsp; She wiped
them away, and turned in bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;m as God made &rsquo;em, master; please Him
they&rsquo;ll be better friends come Davey grows up.&nbsp; But
what must us do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do?&nbsp; Nought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely you&rsquo;ve got your son&rsquo;s good at
heart?&nbsp; Think what &rsquo;tis for Dick to see that wicked
girl coolin&rsquo;, coolin&rsquo;, by inches.&nbsp; Gall for him,
poor dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the man only laughed sleepily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Strongest wins
in this world.&nbsp; If Richard ban&rsquo;t stout enough to keep
his woman by his own arts, us can&rsquo;t help him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might send this young chap &rsquo;bout his
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; fling away two pound a week?&nbsp; No,
fay!&nbsp; Girls is easier picked up than two pound a week.&nbsp;
Let Dick do what&rsquo;s in him.&nbsp; He ban&rsquo;t
&rsquo;feard of that slack-twisted, yellow-haired chap, be
he?&nbsp; Let him show the maiden which is the better man,
an&rsquo; not come bleating to his mother, like a hungry lamb to
a ewe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never comed hisself.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s to hinder him from using his
fistes?&nbsp; Nought brings a man down in a girl&rsquo;s eyes
like a good hiding.&nbsp; Let &rsquo;em settle it same way as the
tomcats do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do b&rsquo;lieve your heart be made o&rsquo; moor
stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good job if &rsquo;twas.&nbsp; Ban&rsquo;t no use being
built o&rsquo; putty, nor yet o&rsquo; pity, &rsquo;pon
Dartymoor.&nbsp; Now shut your clack, an&rsquo; let me go to
sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman sighed, and closed her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell Dick what you say.&nbsp; Good night,
master.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
235</span>CHAPTER V</h3>
<p>Anthony Maybridge had in truth discovered that everything
depends upon the point of view.&nbsp; What was a deed past
understanding in one woman, appeared to him quite defensible for
another.&nbsp; He had grown into a very steady admiration of Jane
Stanberry, and he told himself that her attachment to the
warrener was a serious error.&nbsp; This he firmly believed,
apart from the other question of his personal regard for
Jane.&nbsp; He discussed the matter with a grand impartiality,
and felt confident that her future must be ruined if shared with
such a surly and cross-grained churl as Richard Daccombe.</p>
<p>Presently he expressed the same fear to Jane herself, and she
was much astonished to find no great indignation flame up in her
mind before such a proposition.&nbsp; She confessed the thought
had occurred to her, and asked Anthony how it could have struck
him also.&nbsp; Whereupon he declared that his suspicion was
awakened solely from disinterested regard for her welfare and
future happiness.&nbsp; In brief, a situation stale enough
developed, with that brisk growth to be observed in all similar
complications when they are exhibited by primitive natures.&nbsp;
<a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>Such
seeds grow in virgin and uncultured hearts with a rapidity not
manifest where the subjects are sophisticated and bound about
with the etiquette of their order.</p>
<p>Jane Stanberry observed the radical differences between these
men; she found Dick&rsquo;s cloudy spirit and gloomy nature grow
daily darker by contrast with the generous and sanguine
temperament of Anthony.&nbsp; Indeed, Richard did grow more
morose, as was to be expected, while he watched such a play
develop and apparently stood powerless as any other spectator to
change the plot of it.</p>
<p>But at last his sense of wrong pricked passion, and he stirred
himself.&nbsp; Most firmly he believed all fault lay with
Maybridge alone, and he attributed to that youth a guile and
subtlety quite beyond his real powers of mind.&nbsp; Dick accused
his rival of having seduced the love of Jane against her inner
will&mdash;a thing obviously not possible; and upon that
judgement he prepared to act.</p>
<p>For her part, the girl let conscience sting until the stab
grew dull and failed to disturb her comfort.&nbsp; Each
exhibition of ferocity from Richard lessened her uneasiness, and
justified her in her own eyes.&nbsp; She plotted to meet the
other man in secret; yet still she played a double part, and
outwardly pretended that Dick was all in all to her.</p>
<p>So stood things when Mary Daccombe spoke to <a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>her son;
and his father&rsquo;s advice seemed good to the man, and chimed
very harmoniously with personal desire, for he had reached a
point where he itched to bruise and batter his adversary.&nbsp;
Chance helped him in his ambition, and a discovery fired him to
instant force of arms.</p>
<p>Returning home from the Moor upon a night when it was supposed
that he meant to stop in his hut on the warren, Richard came
through the ruins, and was astonished to see a light glimmering
from the silent desolation.&nbsp; It had grown late on a cold,
moonlit night in late January, and nothing could have been more
unexpected than the presence of any human being in the old
powder-mills at such a time.&nbsp; Supposing that he had
surprised his brother Davey, Dick crept silently to the spot, and
presently discovered that the brightness gleamed in two bars set
at a right angle, and flashed from behind the door of a
ruin.&nbsp; The place was windowless, but the ill-fitting
entrance revealed a flame within.&nbsp; Richard recognised the
building as Case House No. 4, and at once associated the intruder
with his brother.&nbsp; Even as he did so, his heart beat faster
at the thought of danger&mdash;not to Davey, but himself.&nbsp;
Creeping closer, however, voices reached him, and he discovered
that Anthony Maybridge and Jane Stanberry were there
together.</p>
<p>Tingling with passion, he had some ado to keep <a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>from
kicking in the door and bursting upon them; but he desisted, and
with an effort crept away to reflect.&nbsp; Almost immediately
upon his departure he heard them following, so he turned and met
them not far from the little bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fine night for a walk wi&rsquo; another man&rsquo;s
girl,&rdquo; he said, suddenly appearing out of darkness and
standing in the way of the guilty pair.&nbsp; &ldquo;You thought
I was out of hearing, no doubt, as you&rsquo;ve thought often
enough of late, I&rsquo;ll swear, when I was closer than you
reckoned.&nbsp; For two pins I&rsquo;d blow your fool&rsquo;s
head off your shoulders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane shrank back, and Maybridge stammered and stuttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the way to talk,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk!&nbsp; God&rsquo;s truth, I ban&rsquo;t here to
talk&mdash;I leave that for you.&nbsp; What be you doing
wi&rsquo; my maid these many days?&nbsp; Tell me that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad of this.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
felt an awful brute lately; but you&rsquo;ll make me feel better
in a minute.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been telling Jane that she&rsquo;s
making a big mistake to marry you.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s my honest
opinion, and I ought to have told you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest!&nbsp; Wonder the word doan&rsquo;t choke you,
you gert, hulking, lazy clown!&nbsp; Behind a man&rsquo;s back to
do it!&nbsp; Thief that you be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never hidden from
Jane&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut your mouth, you hookem-snivey fox, or <a
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>I&rsquo;ll
hammer your white teeth down your throat!&nbsp; Stand up to me,
now this instant moment, an&rsquo; us&rsquo;ll see who&rsquo;s
the best man.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis time this here woman knowed,
an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll show her the straw you&rsquo;m made of, for
all your size.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He flung down his gun and his coat, then turned up his sleeves
and waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t fight before a
girl&mdash;impossible,&rdquo; said Anthony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doan&rsquo;t she want us to?&nbsp; Ban&rsquo;t she
hungry to see us do it?&nbsp; Ban&rsquo;t she a female, like the
rest of &rsquo;em?&nbsp; Come on, or I&rsquo;ll beat you like a
dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of making an exhibition of
yourself, Richard?&nbsp; I was &lsquo;runner-up&rsquo; in the
amateur heavy-weights two years running.&nbsp; I can smother you,
but I don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doan&rsquo;t blow so loud afore you see what &rsquo;tis
to fight a chap in the right,&rdquo; cried Richard, with
passion.</p>
<p>So we shift our standpoint at the beck of chance, and call
virtue to our aid when accidentally enrolled under her
banner.&nbsp; He stood where he had lied to his little brother
and trampled Davey&rsquo;s fish into the ground and laughed at
the child&rsquo;s rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go,&rdquo; said Maybridge to
Jane.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry about this,
but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was cut short, for the other rushed in and struck him a
heavy blow on the side of the face.&nbsp; Anthony shook his head
and snorted.</p>
<p><a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>&ldquo;If you will have it, you shall,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;m sorry, because you&rsquo;re right and
I&rsquo;m in the wrong&mdash;more or less.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane fled at the first blow, and the battle began.&nbsp;
Maybridge quickly proved the looseness of his great limbs was
combined with other gifts proper to a boxer.&nbsp; He smarted
doubly; from the other&rsquo;s insults and from the sense that
they were deserved.&nbsp; He had ill-used Richard, and his
dislike for him, once loosened, was proportionately bitter.</p>
<p>Stung thus, the young man let his strength and skill have
vent.&nbsp; He took and gave some punishment, but he was a
disciplined fighter, and very easily kept out the heavy rushes of
the keeper.&nbsp; Then, at the first opportunity which Richard
offered, Maybridge knocked him squarely off his legs with a
tremendous blow over the heart.&nbsp; He rose slowly, but the
edge of his strength was gone.&nbsp; His anger nearly blinded him
before this reverse, while Anthony, on the other hand, had fought
himself into a good humour.&nbsp; Presently at close quarters he
hit rather low, and Dick cursed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fight fair, you devil!&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair enough,&rdquo; puffed the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well
up on your small ribs you&rsquo;ll see the mark in the
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By mutual consent they rested presently; then the battle was
renewed, and, knowing himself <a name="page241"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 241</span>beaten at every point of the game,
Richard Daccombe let his temper loose and fell to fighting like a
dog rather than a man.&nbsp; Now it was the other&rsquo;s turn to
cry caution; but the keeper had no ears&mdash;he only lusted to
do injury.&nbsp; Once Maybridge might have knocked him out of
time, but he desisted; then, angered by a brutal kick on the calf
of the leg, he got inside Dick&rsquo;s arms, clenched, gripped
the smaller man like a bear, and with a cross buttock hurled him
heavily backward.&nbsp; They had fought to the river&rsquo;s
bank, and now, luckily for the looser&rsquo;s neck, he fell into
the water.&nbsp; He struggled to his feet, and stood a moment
where moonlight played upon the foaming stream.&nbsp; Then he
crawled to the bank, and had scarcely strength to climb it.&nbsp;
There he lay panting for some time.&nbsp; Anthony brought him his
coat, and offered to give him an arm home; but Dick declined, and
getting on to his feet with difficulty, walked along beside his
conqueror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the beginning,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;not
the end.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t leave Cross Ways before the
week&rsquo;s out, you never will&mdash;not alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk rot like that.&nbsp; I thought you
were a good sportsman anyway, but I see you&rsquo;re not; and
that&rsquo;s the worst you can say against any man.&nbsp; I was
going&mdash;God&rsquo;s my judge that I&rsquo;m telling you the
truth&mdash;I was going away to-morrow&mdash;for a <a
name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>time, at
any rate.&nbsp; She wished it.&nbsp; But now&mdash;now you
threaten me as if you were a murderer, I shan&rsquo;t move, not
an inch.&nbsp; And if there&rsquo;s any blackguardly attempt on
your part to do me an injury, I&rsquo;ll break your neck,
Daccombe; so now you&rsquo;re warned.&nbsp; Anyway, you have
shown that I was right, for any girl would be a madwoman to marry
such a lunatic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk on, now, if you&rsquo;ve got the wind to do
it,&rdquo; answered Richard, &ldquo;but the last word will be
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>CHAPTER VI</h3>
<p>A black malignity dominated the beaten man after his reverse;
and, inasmuch as Jane Stanberry, now at the cross ways of her
life, fell from honour and played a base part out of fear, her
lover continued to believe that his enemy alone was responsible
for Jane&rsquo;s weakness.&nbsp; He blamed the girl, but his love
did not diminish, and he still supposed that Anthony Maybridge
once removed, she would return to him with eyes that again saw
clearly.&nbsp; He attributed his conqueror&rsquo;s conduct to a
tremendous strength of purpose, whereas mere feebleness and an
amorous nature were responsible for it.&nbsp; The woman was at
least as guilty as the man; and now an added blame belonged to
her, for while Anthony henceforth openly declared himself the
rival of Richard, she held the balance a little longer between
them&mdash;chiefly from fear of Mrs. Daccombe.&nbsp; Her decision
was made, yet very carefully she concealed it, and Richard
continued in error.</p>
<p>From his mistaken conclusion, and smarting still with venom
bred of the wounds Anthony had inflicted, the keeper proceeded to
a criminal deed.&nbsp; <a name="page244"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 244</span>Such active hatred as he now felt
stuck at nothing, and within a fortnight of his reverse came the
evil inspiration that he waited for.</p>
<p>A veiled antagonism reigned between the men after their
battle; then matters seemed to sink into customary course.&nbsp;
Richard absented himself from home more than usual; Anthony
abandoned shooting, and took to hunting instead.</p>
<p>Once more it happened that the warrener saw a light burning in
No. 4 Case House by night, and, passing by, heard Maybridge
within, whistling to pass the time until Jane&rsquo;s
arrival.&nbsp; Richard slunk by awhile, and presently, like a
ghost, Jane flitted past him.&nbsp; A flash of light fell upon
the waste as she opened the door; then all grew dark again.&nbsp;
Still the wronged lover remained within earshot, and accident
killed his sudden gust of passion against the girl, for he heard
a sob and listened to a weak, vain protest from her against the
double part she was constrained to play.&nbsp; She accused
Anthony of drawing her to him against all honour and right
feeling; whereupon the listener departed, not desirous to hear
more, and confirmed in his belief.</p>
<p>He visited the old Case House in the middle of the next day,
and ground his teeth at sight of a rough carving&mdash;two hearts
with familiar initials beneath them.&nbsp; Then he examined the
concealed <a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
245</span>blasting powder, and surveyed its position with respect
to the main walls of the building.&nbsp; Satisfied of this, he
proceeded into the air, took a heavy clasp knife, dug down a foot
beneath the grass and turf and removed two bricks from the
foundation of the Case House.&nbsp; Within them was a thin layer
of concrete; the matchboarding followed; and then came the
gunpowder.&nbsp; Calculating the exact spot of his excavation,
Richard entered the hut and pursued his work from inside, after
carefully moving the powder beyond reach of any spark that might
be struck from his attack on the concrete.&nbsp; With light,
numerous blows he gained his end, and soon had a clean hole
running from beneath the magazine to the ground outside.&nbsp;
This he filled with gunpowder, replaced the mass of the explosive
above it, returned the bricks to their original positions, and
covered up the space outside with turf and dry fern.</p>
<p>A scrap of touchwood and a match would do all the rest.</p>
<p>Richard Daccombe completed his preparations just in time, for
as he moved away to the Moor, he saw his brother Davey in the
valley.&nbsp; Thereupon Dick hid behind a rock to surprise the
youngster unpleasantly should his goal be the Case House.&nbsp;
But Davey had either seen his brother, or knew that he was not
far distant.&nbsp; At least, he showed <a
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>himself too
wary to run any risk, and pursued an innocent matter of climbing
a pine tree for a wood-pigeon&rsquo;s nest.&nbsp; Nor did he come
down again until Richard had gone upon his way to the warren.</p>
<h3><a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span>CHAPTER VII</h3>
<p>Events by no means conspired to shake the keeper&rsquo;s evil
determination.&nbsp; Lulled to fancied security and a belief that
his indifference indicated a change of mind toward her, Jane
continued her attention to Dick; and he abstained from upbraiding
her, for he took this display to be love, and felt more than ever
assured that, Maybridge once out of the way, the girl would waken
as from a dream to the reality of his regard and worship.&nbsp;
Her conduct, indeed, obscured his own affection, but he came of a
class that takes life and its tender relations callously.&nbsp;
The only ardent and worthy emotion that had ever made his heart
throb quicker was this girl.&nbsp; His love was still alive, nor
could anger kill it while he continued blind to the truth that
she no longer cared for him.</p>
<p>A fortnight after his visit to the Case House, Dick descended
by night from his den upon the high moor, and the dim flicker of
a flame he had long desired to see strung his nerves to
steel.&nbsp; For fulfilment of his plan it was necessary that he
should come pat on the interval between the arrival of Anthony
Maybridge at this tryst and Jane&rsquo;s <a
name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>subsequent
approach.&nbsp; Twice he had been too late; to-night he arrived
in time, and his opportunity waited for him.&nbsp; Maybridge was
alone.&nbsp; The light burnt in silence.&nbsp; Then came a
solitary footfall on the hollow floor above the gunpowder.</p>
<p>Daccombe had calculated every action that would combine to
complete and perfect the deed now before him.&nbsp; Nor had he
disdained to consider the result.&nbsp; No witness could rise up
against him; his enemy would be blown out of physical existence,
and his own subsequent declaration that some tons of blasting
powder remained forgotten in the old magazine must serve to
explain the rest.&nbsp; A spark from Anthony&rsquo;s pipe would
be a satisfactory solution.</p>
<p>The man set about his murder swiftly and stealthily.&nbsp; He
had already driven a heavy staple into the door of the Case
House, and now, without a sound, he fastened his victim firmly
in, using some lengths of brass rabbit wire for the
purpose.&nbsp; Then he crept down below the level of the
building, scratched away the turf and fern and moved the loosened
bricks.&nbsp; He felt the powder dry under his hand, brought a
large lump of rotten wood from his breast pocket, where he had
long carried it, and struck a match.&nbsp; Soon the touchwood
glowed, and he set it down, leapt from his work and hastened away
along the path by which Jane must presently <a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
249</span>approach.&nbsp; Thus he designed to intercept her
progress, and, upon some pretence or excuse, draw her from the
zone of danger.&nbsp; As to that last point, however, he was
doubtful.&nbsp; The amount of the powder he could not accurately
tell, and the extent of the explosion remained to be seen.&nbsp;
Richard calculated that three minutes, if not a longer period,
must elapse before fire would gnaw up the dead wood and reach the
powder; and now, as he moved hastily away, the seconds lengthened
into minutes, and the minutes most horribly dragged.&nbsp; An
infinite abyss of time widened out between the deed and its
effect.&nbsp; He lived his life again; and still he peered
through the darkness with his eyes, and strained upon the silence
with his ears, that he might not let Jane Stanberry pass him and
go ignorantly to destruction.</p>
<p>He was a quarter of a mile from the Case House, when it seemed
as though the heavens were opened and Doomsday suddenly loosed
upon the world.&nbsp; An awful and withering explosion swept the
glen like a storm.&nbsp; First there leapt aloft a pillar of pale
fire, that rose and spread as the eruption of a volcano
spreads.&nbsp; The terrific glare painted long miles of the Moor,
and like the hand of lightning, revealed the shaggy crowns of the
tors on many a distant hill; while, long before its livid sheaf
of flame had sunk, came such a crash and bellow of <a
name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>sound as
might burst from the upheaval of a world in earthquake.&nbsp;
Upon this appalling detonation a wave of air swept in sudden
tempest.&nbsp; Richard was blown off his feet and dashed to the
ground; and as he fell, the hills echoed back the explosion in
crashing reverberations that rolled out of the darkness, rose and
fell, and rose again, until, after a hundred repetitions flung
hither and thither over the peaks of the land, they sank through
a growling diminuendo into silence.&nbsp; And the silence was
terrific by contrast with the awful clamour it succeeded, even as
the darkness was intense that followed upon such an unwonted and
far-flung glare of light.</p>
<p>Richard Daccombe got upon his feet, and the tinkle of broken
glass was in his ears, with the murmur of affrighted voices; for
the concussion had shattered nearly every pane at Cross Ways, and
mightily alarmed the dwellers there.</p>
<p>When he reached home the young keeper found his parents
already out-of-doors, with the whole household assembled about
them.</p>
<p>Mary Daccombe praised God at sight of her son uninjured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the end of the world, by the sound of
it,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where be Davey to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His father questioned Richard, and the man declared his
ignorance of all particulars.</p>
<p><a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
251</span>&ldquo;An explosion at the old powder-mills, or else a
bolt from heaven,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must have
passed by the very place, I reckon, not five minutes before the
upstore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thunder-planet, for sartain,&rdquo; declared an
ancient soul, whose few teeth chattered between his words.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I can call home when a com-com-comet was reigning fifty
years an&rsquo; more agone, an&rsquo; &rsquo;twas just such open
weather as us have had o&rsquo; late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Daccombe felt anxious for his stock in certain byres and
cow-houses that lay to the west of the powder-mills.&nbsp; But
first he held up a lantern and counted the company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be us all here?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davey&rsquo;s out somewheers,&rdquo; answered his wife;
&ldquo;ess, an&rsquo; Jane Stanberry be&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; She
broke off, and looked at the farmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down-long, I s&rsquo;pose,&rdquo; he said carelessly;
then he turned to Richard.&nbsp; &ldquo;Us can&rsquo;t blink
these meetings between &rsquo;em, Dick.&nbsp; Best man wins where
a maid&rsquo;s the prize; or which she thinks be the best.&nbsp;
Awnly God send her ban&rsquo;t in the powder-mills
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis most certain she be,&rdquo; answered Mary
Daccombe.&nbsp; &ldquo;Her didn&rsquo;t know as the young
man&mdash;Mr. Maybridge&mdash;was called off sudden to Moreton to
serve &rsquo;pon a committee for the Hunt Dinner next
month.&nbsp; A chap rode out, and he saddled his <a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>mare
hisself and galloped off we him directly after he&rsquo;d ate his
meat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jane didn&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; asked Richard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she went out counting to find him, I&rsquo;m
afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; he&rsquo;m at Moreton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man asked in a voice so strange that none failed to note
it, even in this dark moment of fear and turmoil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her went to wait for him usual place, no doubt,&rdquo;
said Jonathan Daccombe.&nbsp; &ldquo;Us had better come an&rsquo;
look around for her, an&rsquo; Davey too&mdash;not to name the
things in the long byre by the wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A hideous cry suddenly cut Jonathan short, for a storm had
swept the sinner&rsquo;s brain upon these words.&nbsp; He saw
what he had done, and the shock overset the balance of his
mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve killed her,
I&rsquo;ve ended her days in a scatter of blood and flesh!&nbsp;
Nought to show for the butivul round body of her now.&nbsp; But
her shall have Christian burial, if &rsquo;tis awnly a hair of
her head left to put in the churchyard; an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
mourn for her on my knees, afore they string me up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s goodness! what gabble be this?&rdquo; asked
his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Maybridge still alive, wi&rsquo; no smell of fire
about him.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>He
broke off and gazed round him wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon the Moreton road as he comes home-along!&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; Then the wretch turned to hurry away.&nbsp; At the
first step, however, he stopped and stood as still as a statue,
for he had heard what was hidden from the ears of the rest.&nbsp;
Then they too caught the sound of footsteps and a murmuring in
the night.&nbsp; Richard remained without moving, and his eyes
glared into the dark, and his jaw had fallen.&nbsp; Then, taking
shape and coming slowly into the radius of lantern light, there
moved a woman and a boy.</p>
<p>Jane Stanberry approached, holding Davey by the hand; and at
sight of her Richard Daccombe screamed out his shattered senses,
and fled as one possessed of an evil spirit.&nbsp; In vain they
made search for him by night and day, and it was not until more
than eight-and-forty hours had passed that they found him
wandering in the great central loneliness insane.&nbsp; There
they ministered to him, and brought him home; and time so dealt
with him that he sank into a harmless and haunted idiocy&mdash;a
horror for his father, a knife in his mother&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>Now it happened that Richard&rsquo;s brother, upon the
keeper&rsquo;s departure from the Case House on a day already
noted, had descended from his pine tree, made close investigation
of the elder&rsquo;s deed, and guessed that such preparations
were directed <a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
254</span>against one man.&nbsp; From that day until the time of
the catastrophe, David kept silent watch upon all occasions when
Jane and Anthony Maybridge met there.&nbsp; Hidden within a dry
drain some ten yards distant, he had played sentinel until the
night of Richard&rsquo;s revenge.&nbsp; Then he had crept from
his cover the moment the other&rsquo;s back was turned, reached
the smouldering touchwood, and with amazing courage extinguished
it.&nbsp; Afterward, releasing the girl as quickly as possible,
and bidding her run for her life to the shelter of a grinding
mill two hundred yards distant, he had once more set the rotten
wood on fire and hastened after Jane.</p>
<p>She, mystified and indignant, was also conscious that the boy
must be obeyed, and so fled as he ordered her.&nbsp; Yet both
would have perished but for their protection behind the stout
ruin of the grinding mill.&nbsp; And now, the fear of death upon
their faces, they hurried trembling home, and Nemesis came with
them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>To-day a black-bearded man, with brown eyes and a mouth always
open, shambles about the blasted heart of the old
powder-mill.&nbsp; He babbles to himself with many a frown and
pregnant nod and look askance; sometimes he watches the trout in
the river; sometimes he plucks feverishly at the blossoms of the
broom and spearwort and other <a name="page255"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 255</span>yellow flowers.&nbsp; These he
stamps underfoot as one stamps fire.&nbsp; Davey is his
brother&rsquo;s keeper, and shall be seen always at hand.&nbsp;
At his word Richard Daccombe obeys like a dog&mdash;shrinks with
fear if the boy is angry, fawns and laughs when the boy is
kind.</p>
<h2><a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
257</span>JOSEPH</h2>
<p><a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
259</span>&ldquo;I do love they stuckit plants,&rdquo; said Mr.
Joseph Hannaford.</p>
<p>He waved his hands toward some lettuces of a fat figure and
plump proportions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doan&rsquo;t want no work&mdash;that&rsquo;s
why,&rdquo; answered Matthew Smallridge.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
straggly sort be better, but they axes for tying up an&rsquo;
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ezacally so.&nbsp; An&rsquo; a man as goes out of his
way to sow trouble be a fule, Matthew,&rdquo; retorted Joseph,
triumphantly.</p>
<p>The gardeners met every day, and every day differed on affairs
of horticulture and life.&nbsp; Joseph was stout, with a red face
set in a white frill of whisker.&nbsp; He had a rabbit mouth, a
bald brow and a constitutional capacity for idleness.&nbsp; He
talked much.&nbsp; He had a fine theory that we do not leave
enough to nature in matters of the garden.</p>
<p>Mr. Smallridge, the squire&rsquo;s gardener, enjoyed a
different habit of body and mind.&nbsp; He was a man who lived
for work and loved it; he read the journals proper to his
business; he kept his subordinates to their labours from morn
till eve; and idleness he loathed as the worst sin to be laid at
<a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>the door
of any agriculturist, great or small.&nbsp; Mr. Hannaford alleged
that the literature of his business was desirable for beginners,
but he declared it to be unnecessary in his case.&nbsp; If asked
concerning his authorities, he would tap his forehead and say,
&ldquo;Books?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want no books.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
all here.&rdquo;&nbsp; No man possessed sure proofs that he could
either read or write.</p>
<p>These two were ancient men, yet not old for Dartmoor, where
those of hardy stock, who have weathered the ordeal of infancy,
usually advance far into the vale of years before their taking
off.&nbsp; Joseph attributed his excellent health and spirits to
a proper sense of what was due to himself in the matter of rest;
while Matthew, on the other hand, assigned his physical and
mental prosperity to hard work and temperance.&nbsp; Now the men
stood together in Joseph&rsquo;s little garden and discussed
general questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If us was all your way of thinking, theer&rsquo;d be no
progress, an&rsquo; never a new pea growed an&rsquo; never a new
potato taken to a show,&rdquo; said Mr. Smallridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate shows,&rdquo; answered Joseph.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis flying in the face of nature an&rsquo; God
Almighty, all this struggling for size.&nbsp; If He&rsquo;d
a&rsquo; meant to grow twenty peas in a pod, an&rsquo; all so big
as cherries, He&rsquo;d have done it wi&rsquo; a turn o&rsquo;
the wrist.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t do <a name="page261"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 261</span>it, an&rsquo; for us worms to try
an&rsquo; go awver the Lord in the matter of garden-stuff be so
bad as bad can be.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas touching that very thing I
fell out with the Reverend Truman.&nbsp; &lsquo;I be gwaine to
show grapes, Joseph,&rsquo; he said to me last year; an&rsquo; I
nodded an&rsquo; said, &lsquo;Ess, sir,&rsquo; an&rsquo; went my
even way.&nbsp; Us didn&rsquo;t show.&nbsp; Then &rsquo;twas
chrysanths.&nbsp; Weern&rsquo;t satisfied wi&rsquo; a nice,
small, stuggy bloom, as nature meant, but must be pinching,
an&rsquo; potting, an&rsquo; messing with soot an&rsquo; dirt,
an&rsquo; watering twice a day&mdash;ten months&rsquo; toil for
two months&rsquo; pleasure.&nbsp; Then what?&nbsp; A gert,
ramshackly, auld blossom, like a mop dipped in a pail o&rsquo;
paint.&nbsp; However, I let his reverence do the work, an&rsquo;
what credit was about I got myself.&nbsp; Not that I wanted
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As true a Christian your master was as ever walked in a
garden, however,&rdquo; declared Mr. Smallridge.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
hope the new parson will prove so gude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be gwaine to see him this very day,&rdquo; answered
Joseph.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis my hope he&rsquo;ll take me on to
the vicarage, for the place wouldn&rsquo;t be the place without
me up theer.&nbsp; I knaw every blade of grass an&rsquo;
gooseberry bush in it&mdash;a very butivul kitchen-garden
&rsquo;tis too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; well out of sight of the sitting-room
windows,&rdquo; said Matthew Smallridge, grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a kitchen-garden should be,&rdquo; assented
Joseph.&nbsp; &ldquo;Gude times they was,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; <a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
262</span>I only hopes the Reverend Truman have got such a fine
garden an&rsquo; such a&rsquo; honest man in it as he had
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no li&rsquo;l maid to go round with him, poor
soul!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bright child his darter was.&nbsp; Impatient
also&mdash;like youth ever is.&nbsp; Her&rsquo;d bring me plants
to coddle, an&rsquo; expect me to waste my precious time looking
after her rubbish.&nbsp; Then a thing would be struck for death,
along of want of water or what not, an&rsquo; her&rsquo;d come to
me wi&rsquo; her li&rsquo;l face all clouded.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t &rsquo;e make it well again, Joseph?&rsquo;
her&rsquo;d say; an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;No, missy;
&rsquo;tis all up wi&rsquo; thicky geranium,&rsquo; or whatever
&rsquo;twas.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis gwaine home.&rsquo;&nbsp;
An&rsquo; her&rsquo;d stamp her li&rsquo;l foot so savage
an&rsquo; ferocious, an&rsquo; say, `But it <i>mustn&rsquo;t</i>
go home!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t <i>want</i> it to go home!&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis your business not to let it go home!&rsquo; Poor
little maiden!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; now she&rsquo;ve gone home
herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ess.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t mean to be rude to an auld
man.&nbsp; But of course I couldn&rsquo;t be bothered with such
trash.&nbsp; As to watering, I always leave it to Nature.&nbsp;
Who be us that we should knaw better what things want than her
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nature caan&rsquo;t water green stuff onder glass, can
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; then why put it onder glass?&nbsp; All this here
talk &rsquo;bout glass houses is vanity an&rsquo; flying in the
face of Providence.&nbsp; If &rsquo;twas meant that grapes <a
name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>an&rsquo;
tree-ferns an&rsquo; &rsquo;zaleas an&rsquo; hothouse stuff was
to flourish in England, they&rsquo;d be here doing of it on every
mountain-side.&nbsp; Us takes too much &rsquo;pon
ourselves.&nbsp; Same with prayers.&nbsp; What be prayer most
times but trying to get the A&rsquo;mighty round to our way of
thinking?&nbsp; We&rsquo;m too busy,&mdash;most of
us,&mdash;an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jimmery!&rdquo; exclaimed Matthew.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never
did in all my born days hear tell of the like o&rsquo; you!&nbsp;
You won&rsquo;t work an&rsquo; you won&rsquo;t
pray&mdash;&rsquo;tis terrible.&nbsp; All the same, if you
don&rsquo;t get the vicarage again, an&rsquo; come as
under-gardener to the squire, as he&rsquo;ve offered you, I tell
you frankly, friends though we be, that you&rsquo;ll have to work
harder than you&rsquo;ve worked for twenty years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it very well, Matt,&rdquo; said Mr.
Hannaford.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your way an&rsquo; mine be different,
root an&rsquo; branch; an&rsquo; I pray God as I may not have to
come under you, for I&rsquo;d hate it properly, an&rsquo;
that&rsquo;s the truth.&nbsp; An&rsquo; I do work, an&rsquo; I do
pray likewise; an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d back my chance of going up
aloft with my last shirt, if there was any to take the bet.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;m too self-righteous along of your high
wages&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joseph! &rsquo;tis time you put on your black,&rdquo;
cried a voice from the cottage door.</p>
<p>Here grew a feeble honeysuckle that had been nailed up four
years before, and still struggled gamely with a north aspect and
neglect.</p>
<p><a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>On
the other side of the doorway was a thrush in a cage.&nbsp; It
appeared too spiritless even to mount its wooden perch, but sat
on the floor of its prison and listlessly pecked at nothing.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hannaford had a thin, flat figure, a hard mouth, keen
eyes and a face like a fowl.&nbsp; Tremendous force of character
marked her pale visage.&nbsp; The grey curls that hung there on
each side of her narrow forehead looked like steel shavings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dress,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;an&rsquo; be quick about
it.&nbsp; Ah, Mr. Smallridge&mdash;helping Joseph to waste his
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not me, ma&rsquo;am; that&rsquo;s about the only job he
doesn&rsquo;t want helping with.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve just been
telling your man that if Mr. Budd to the vicarage doan&rsquo;t
need him, an&rsquo; he takes squire&rsquo;s offer an&rsquo; comes
to me, theer must be more work an&rsquo; less talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The new parson will want him,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Hannaford, decidedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who should stick a spade in
that earth after twenty-five years if not Joseph?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very plants would cry out if anybody else was put awver
them,&rdquo; said Mr. Hannaford, sentimentally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cry out for joy, I reckon,&rdquo; murmured Matthew, but
not loud enough for his friend&rsquo;s wife to overhear
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Theer&rsquo;s wan thing you should know,&rdquo;
he continued, changing the subject.&nbsp; &ldquo;Parson Budd be a
tremendous Church of Englander, so I heard squire say.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;ve got his knife into all chapel-people an&rsquo;
free-thinkers an&rsquo; such like.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
265</span>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a free country,&rdquo; answered Mrs.
Hannaford, and her curls almost appeared to clatter as she shook
her head.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;d better mind his awn business,
which be faith, hope an&rsquo; charity, an&rsquo; not poke his
nose into other people&rsquo;s prayers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for religion,&rdquo; declared Joseph, &ldquo;the
little as I&rsquo;ve got time for in that line be done along with
my missis an&rsquo; the Plymouth Brethren.&nbsp; But theer
ban&rsquo;t no smallness in me.&nbsp; Room in the Lard&rsquo;s
mansions for all of us; an&rsquo; if the roads be narrer,
theer&rsquo;s plenty of &rsquo;em, an&rsquo; plenty of gates to
the Golden Jerusalem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hannaford frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;m too free with your views, Joseph
Hannaford,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;d best call to
mind what pastor said to chapel last Sunday, &rsquo;bout the
camel an&rsquo; the needle&rsquo;s eye.&nbsp; Many be called
an&rsquo; few chosen, so theer&rsquo;s an end of it.&nbsp; The
Brethren&rsquo;s way be the right way an&rsquo; the strait way;
an&rsquo; ban&rsquo;t your business to be breaking gates into
heaven for them as do wrong, an&rsquo; think wrong, an&rsquo;
haven&rsquo;t a spark of charity, an&rsquo; be busy about the
Dowl&rsquo;s work in every other cottage in this village.&nbsp; I
know what church folks be&mdash;nobody better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Smallridge, himself of the established religion, retreated
before this outburst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell of a female that,&rdquo; he said to himself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How the man can keep heart after all these years <a
name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>be a
mystery.&nbsp; Yet she sits light upon him, seemingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Joseph, with some groans and grumbles, went to decorate
himself, that the new incumbent might smile upon him and
reappoint him to the care of the vicarage garden.&nbsp; He shaved
very carefully, washed, showed Mrs. Hannaford his
finger-nails,&mdash;a matter he usually shirked,&mdash;donned his
best attire, and finally started beside his wife to appear before
Mr. Budd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a grievous choice,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;an&rsquo; if the man doan&rsquo;t take me on, I&rsquo;ll
have to go to the Hall under Smallridge&mdash;a very
ill-convenient thing to think upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a matter of form, but better the Hall than
any paltering with what&rsquo;s right; an&rsquo; better be under
Smallridge than against your conscience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My conscience is very well, an&rsquo; always have been
since I was a bwoy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;m a deal tu easy, however,&rdquo; she
answered sternly&mdash;&ldquo;a deal tu easy, an&rsquo;
you&rsquo;ll very likely find that out when &rsquo;tis tu
late.&nbsp; Your conscience be like proud-flesh, I reckon:
don&rsquo;t hurt &rsquo;e &rsquo;cause &rsquo;tis past
feeling.&nbsp; I wish it pricked you so often as your rheumatics
do.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twould be a sign of grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;m like poor Parson Truman&rsquo;s li&rsquo;l
maiden wi&rsquo; her flowers, you be,&rdquo; he retorted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Her was always dragging up the things to see how they <a
name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>prospered,
an&rsquo; you&rsquo;m always dragging up your conscience by the
roots, same way, to see how &rsquo;tis faring.&nbsp; I let mine
bide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; snapped back Mrs.
Hannaford.&nbsp; &ldquo;Conscience ban&rsquo;t built to
bide&mdash;no more&rsquo;n a growing pear upon a tree.&nbsp; It
goes from gude to better, or else from bad to worse.&nbsp; You
ban&rsquo;t so righteous-minded as I could wish &rsquo;e, Joseph;
but I&rsquo;ve done a deal for you since we&rsquo;ve been man
an&rsquo; wife; an&rsquo; if you&rsquo;m spared ten year more, I
lay I&rsquo;ll have your conscience to work so hard as a man
saving his own hay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pity you can&rsquo;t live an&rsquo; let live, my
dear,&rdquo; answered the gardener.&nbsp; &ldquo;Even the weeds
was made by God for His own ends, as I always told Truman.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;m a very religious woman; an&rsquo; nobody knaws it
better&rsquo;n you; all the same, if folks&rsquo; consciences ax
for such a power of watching, &rsquo;tis enough for every human
to look after theer own, surely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why for don&rsquo;t you do it, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the vicarage,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Us better not go in warm&mdash;might be against us.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll dust my boots, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;d best to cool your
face, for &rsquo;tis glistening like the moon in the
sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently they stood before a busy newcomer.&nbsp; He proved a
young, plump, and pleasant man&mdash;a man fond of fishing and
fox-hunting, a man of rotund voice and rotund figure.&nbsp;
Joseph&rsquo;s heart <a name="page268"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 268</span>grew hopeful.&nbsp; Here was no
dragon of horticulture, but one, like himself, who would live and
let live, and doubtless leave the garden in the hands of its
professional attendant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your servant, sir,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope
your honour be very well an&rsquo; likes the church an&rsquo; the
hunt&mdash;also the garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Joseph Hannaford, I suppose, and this is Mrs.
Hannaford&mdash;good parishioners both, of course?&nbsp; Sit
down, Mrs. Hannaford, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis in a nutshell, sir, an&rsquo; we won&rsquo;t
keep a busy gentleman from his business,&rdquo; said the old
woman, very politely.&nbsp; &ldquo;Joseph here have been gardener
at the vicarage, man an&rsquo; bwoy, for twenty-five
years&mdash;ever since theer was a garden at all.&nbsp; He helped
to cut out the peat an&rsquo; make the place, as was just a
new-take from Dartymoor, though now &rsquo;tis so good stuff as
ever growed a cabbage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ess fay; all rotted manure an&rsquo; butivul loam, so
sweet as sugar, an&rsquo; drains like a sieve,&rdquo; declared
Joseph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want a gardener, of course, and cannot do better than
Mr. Hannaford, though I&rsquo;m not sure if it isn&rsquo;t too
much for one elderly man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is!&rdquo; almost shouted Joseph.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never
a Bible prophet said a truer word!&nbsp; Too much by half.&nbsp;
Not that I&rsquo;d demean myself to ax for another man, but a
bwoy I should have, an&rsquo; I hope your <a
name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>honour will
give me a bwoy, if &rsquo;tis only to fetch an&rsquo;
carry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What wages did you get from Mr. Truman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pound a week; an&rsquo; another shilling would be a
godsend, if I may say it without offence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; up to squire&rsquo;s they only offered him
seventeen an&rsquo; sixpence, with all his ripe
experience,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hannaford.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Twould be a fine lesson in Christianity to squire,
I&rsquo;m sure, if you seed your way to twenty-one
shilling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better than a waggon-load of sermons, if I may say
so,&rdquo; continued Joseph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sight better, seeing squire&rsquo;s not greatly
&rsquo;dicted to church-gwaine, best of times,&rdquo; chimed in
Mrs. Hannaford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be under-gardener there, no
doubt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ezacally so, dear sir.&nbsp; Under-gardener beneath
Smallridge&mdash;a man three year younger than me.&nbsp; But
ban&rsquo;t for me to tell my parts.&nbsp; All the same, I
wouldn&rsquo;t work under Smallridge, not for money, if I could
help it.&nbsp; Very rash views he&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;bout
broccoli, not to name roots an&rsquo; sparrowgrass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terrible wilful touching fruit, also, they tells
me,&rdquo; added Mrs. Hannaford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you must come, I suppose.&nbsp; I could hardly
turn you out of your old garden; nor is there any need to do
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; thank you with all my heart, your <a
name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>honour;
an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll never regret it so long as I be
spared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The extra shilling you shall have.&nbsp; As to a boy, I
want a stable-boy, and he&rsquo;ll be able to lend you a hand in
the summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hannaford nodded, touched his forehead, and mentally
arranged a full programme for the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough said, then.&nbsp; On Monday I shall expect you,
and will walk round with you myself and say what I&rsquo;ve got
to say.&nbsp; Good-bye for the present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Budd rose, and the old pair, with many expressions of
satisfaction, were about to depart when their vicar spoke
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more matter I may mention, though doubtless there
is no necessity to do so with two such sensible people.&nbsp;
There are more sects and conventicles here than I like to find in
such a very small parish.&nbsp; Of course you come to church
every Sunday, Mr. Hannaford?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to that, your honour&mdash;&rdquo; began Joseph;
then his wife silenced him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;m Plymouth Brethren from conscience,&rdquo;
she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You ban&rsquo;t gwaine to object,
surely&mdash;you as have come here to preach charity an&rsquo;
such like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Budd flushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to do my duty, ma&rsquo;am, and
don&rsquo;t <a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
271</span>need to be told what that is by my parishioners, I
hope.&nbsp; All servants of the vicarage will, as a matter of
course, go to church twice every Sunday, and upon week-days also,
if I express any wish to that effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em, then,&rdquo; answered the old woman,
fiercely.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can bind &rsquo;em in chains of iron,
if you will, an&rsquo; they&rsquo;m feeble-hearted enough to let
&rsquo;e.&nbsp; But us won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Us be what we be,
an&rsquo; Plymouth Brethren have got somethin&rsquo; better to do
than go hunting foxes, whether or no.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a growed
woman, an&rsquo; Joseph&rsquo;s my husband, an&rsquo; he
shan&rsquo;t be in bondage to no man.&nbsp; To squire&rsquo;s
garden he shall go, an&rsquo; save his sawl alive, so now
then!&nbsp; Gude evening, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I may have a tell&mdash;&rdquo; began Joseph, in a
tremor of emotion; but his wife cut him short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may not,&rdquo; she cried sternly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
come home.&nbsp; Least said soonest mended.&nbsp; Awnly I&rsquo;m
sorry to God as a C&aelig;sar of all the Roosias have come to
Postbridge instead of a Christian creature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, she clutched Joseph and led him away.&nbsp; But on
their silent journey homeward Mr. Hannaford pondered this
tremendous circumstance deeply.&nbsp; Then, at his cottage gate,
he rallied and spoke his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done wrong,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; I be gwaine back again to confess to it afore I
sleep this night.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
272</span>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done right.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll save
your sawl an&rsquo; take seventeen shilling an&rsquo;
sixpence.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be a martyr for conscience,
an&rsquo; I be proud of &rsquo;e.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martyr or no martyr, I knaw a silly auld woman,
an&rsquo; I ban&rsquo;t proud of &rsquo;e at all, nor of myself
neither.&nbsp; Anything in reason I&rsquo;d do for you, an&rsquo;
have done ever since I took you; but being put to work in cold
blood under Smallridge is more&rsquo;n I will do for you or for
all the Plymouth Brothers that ever bleated hell-fire to a decent
man.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t go under Smallridge.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d
make me sweat enough to float a ship; an&rsquo; at my time of
life &rsquo;twould shorten my days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord&rsquo;ll help &rsquo;e, Joseph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord helps those who help theerselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;m gwaine to the Hall, however, for I&rsquo;ve
said it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not me&mdash;never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You be, Joseph Hannaford, as I&rsquo;m a living
woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; Not for nobody, Jane!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never
crossed you in my life; I&rsquo;ve knuckled under like a worm for
forty-three year, an&rsquo; shall henceforward just the same; but
wheer Smallridge be in question I&rsquo;m iron.&nbsp; I go to
church next Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never shall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always shall&mdash;an&rsquo; glad to get back.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twas a very silly thing to leave it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>Mrs.
Hannaford put her fowl-like nose within two inches of her
husband&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare you to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ban&rsquo;t no use flustering yourself, my old
dear.&nbsp; Every human man&rsquo;s got one kick in him.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; kick I&rsquo;m gwaine to this instant
moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned and left her with great agility, while she&mdash;the
foundations of her married life suddenly shaken by this
earthquake&mdash;stood and stared and gasped up at heaven.</p>
<p>Joseph quickly vanished into the dusk, and soon stood once
more before the new vicar.&nbsp; Mr. Budd thereupon raised his
eyes from his desk and asked a question without words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, your honour, &rsquo;tis like this here:
I&rsquo;ll go back to church again very next Sunday as falls
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; But I thought that Joseph would be in bondage
to no man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor no woman neither,&rdquo; said Mr. Hannaford.</p>
<h2><a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>A
TRAVELLER&rsquo;S TALE</h2>
<p><a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
277</span>&ldquo;He&rsquo;m a monkey that hath seen the world, no
doubt,&rdquo; said Merryweather Chugg, the water-bailiff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;an&rsquo; brought back some nuts wi&rsquo;
gold kernels, by all accounts,&rdquo; answered Noah Sage;
&ldquo;though he ban&rsquo;t going to crack none here, I reckon,
for the chap&rsquo;s only come to have a look at the home of his
youth; then he&rsquo;m off again to foreign parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two old men sat in the parlour of the
&ldquo;Bellaford&rdquo; Inn at Postbridge, and about them
gathered other labouring folk.&nbsp; All were inhabitants of the
Dartmoor district, and most had been born and bred in the valley
of East Dart or upon adjacent farms.&nbsp; This village, of which
the pride and glory is an old bridge that spans the river, shall
be found upon the shaggy breast of the Moor, like an oasis in the
desert; for here much land has been snatched from the hungry
heath, groves of beech and sycamore lie in the bosom of these
undulating wastes, and close at hand are certain snug tenement
farms whereon men have dwelt and wrestled with the wild land from
time immemorial.</p>
<p>To-day a native had returned to his home; and as a vacant room
at the &ldquo;Bellaford&rdquo; Inn well served <a
name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>his
purpose, Mr. Robert Bates secured it for a fortnight, that he
might wander again about his boyhood&rsquo;s haunts and shine a
little in the eyes of those who still remembered him.&nbsp; That
night he had promised to relate his experiences in the public
bar; he had also let it be known that upon this great occasion
beer and spirits would flow free of all cost for old friends and
new.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have to address a overflowed meeting, like
a Member of Parliament,&rdquo; said Michael French, the Moor-man,
&ldquo;for be blessed if us can all get in your bar, Mrs.
Capern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots of room yet,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if
you&rsquo;d only turn some of they boys out-of-doors.&nbsp; They
won&rsquo;t drink nought, so I&rsquo;d rather have their room
than their company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think you was oncommon excited to see this
chap, ban&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Noah Sage of a very ancient
patriarch in the corner.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was up to Hartland Farm,
when you was head man there, that Bob Bates comed as a
&rsquo;pretence from Moreton Poorhouse, if I can
remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ess fay, &rsquo;tis so,&rdquo; said the other.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You ax un if the thrashings I used to give un every other
day for wasting his time weern&rsquo;t the makin&rsquo; of un;
an&rsquo; if he ban&rsquo;t a liar, he&rsquo;ll say &rsquo;twas
so.&nbsp; If he owes thanks to any man, &rsquo;tis to old Jacob
Pearn&mdash;though I say it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
279</span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the truth, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
allow every word of it, Jacob; an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m terrible glad
you ban&rsquo;t dead, for you were the first I meant to see come
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bates himself spoke.&nbsp; He was a small, wiry man of
fifty or thereabout.&nbsp; His clothes were well cut, and he wore
a gold watch-chain.&nbsp; His face and hands were tanned a deep
brown; his hair was grizzled, and his beard was also growing grey
at the sides.&nbsp; His eyes shone genially as he grasped a dozen
hands in turn, and in turn answered twice a dozen
salutations.</p>
<p>Robert Bates had run away from the heavy hand of Gaffer Pearn
some five and thirty years before the present time, and he looked
round him now and saw but one familiar face; for the old men had
passed from their labours, the middle-aged had taken their
places, his former mates were growing grey and he could not
recognise them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you the whole tale if you&rsquo;m
minded,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis thirty years
long, but give two minutes to each of they years an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;ll finish in a hour.&nbsp; An&rsquo; meantime, Mrs.
Capern&mdash;as was Nancy Bassett, an&rsquo; wouldn&rsquo;t walk
out Sundays with me last time I seed &rsquo;e&mdash;be so good as
to let every gen&rsquo;leman present have what he wants to drink,
for I be going to leave ten pounds in Postbridge, an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;d so soon you had it as anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Great applause greeted this liberal determination.</p>
<p><a name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
280</span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;m an open-handed chap, wherever
you&rsquo;ve comed from,&rdquo; said Merryweather Chugg,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; us all drinks long life an&rsquo; good health to
you an&rsquo; yours, if so be you&rsquo;m a family
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come to that,&rdquo; answered Mr.
Bates.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me sit by the fire, will &rsquo;e?&nbsp;
I do love the smell of the peat, an&rsquo; where I come from, us
don&rsquo;t trouble about fires, I assure &rsquo;e, for a body
can catch heat from the sun all the year round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You was always finger-cold in winter,&rdquo; said Mr.
Pearn.&nbsp; &ldquo;I mind as a boy your colour never altered
from blue in frosty weather, an&rsquo; you had a chilblain
wheresoever a chilblain could find room for itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis so; an&rsquo; when I runned away to mend my
fortune, &rsquo;twas the knowledge that a certain ship were
sailing down to the line into hot weather as made me go for a
sailor.&nbsp; To Plymouth docks I went when I ran off, an&rsquo;
there met a man at the Barbican as axed me to come for cabin-boy;
an&rsquo; when he said they was going where the cocoanuts comed
from, I said I&rsquo;d go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear life!&rdquo; murmured Mrs.
Capern,&mdash;&ldquo;to think what little things do make or mar a
fortune!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis so;&mdash;a drop of rum cold, mother, then
I&rsquo;ll start on my tale.&nbsp; An&rsquo; I may as well say
that every word be true, for Providence have so dealt by me that
to tell a falsehood is the last thing ever I would do.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
281</span>&ldquo;Not but what you used to lie something terrible
when you was young, Bob,&rdquo; said Mr. Pearn, from the
corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, Jacob,&rdquo; answered the traveller;
&ldquo;an&rsquo; hard though you hit, you never hit hard enough
to cure me of lying.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a damned vice, an&rsquo; I
never yet told a fib as paid for telling.&nbsp; But
&rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t you cured me; &rsquo;twas a man by the name
of Mistley, the bo&rsquo;sun of the ship I sailed in.&nbsp; I
told un a stramming gert lie, an&rsquo; he found it out,
an&rsquo;&mdash;well, if you want to know what a proper
dressing-down be, you ax a seafaring man to lay it on.&nbsp; In
them days they didn&rsquo;t reckon they&rsquo;d begun till
they&rsquo;d drawed blood out of &rsquo;e; an&rsquo; so often as
not they&rsquo;d give &rsquo;e a bucket of salt water down your
back arter, just so as you shouldn&rsquo;t forget where
they&rsquo;d been busy.&nbsp; One such hiding I got from Mistley,
an&rsquo; never wanted another.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d so soon have told
that man a second lie as I&rsquo;d told God one to His shining
face.&nbsp; An&rsquo; long after, to show I don&rsquo;t bear no
malice, when I fell on my feet, I went down to the port when my
old ship comed in again two years later, an&rsquo; in my pocket
was five golden pounds for Mistley.&nbsp; Only he&rsquo;d gone
an&rsquo; died o&rsquo; yellow jack in the meantime down to the
Plate, so he never got it.&nbsp; An&rsquo; you boys there,
remember what I say, an&rsquo; never tell no lies if you want to
get on an&rsquo; pocket good wages come presently.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis more than thirty years ago, an&rsquo; the <a
name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>man that
did it dust; yet I wriggles my shoulders an&rsquo; feels the
flesh crawl on my spine to this day when I thinks of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m gwaine too fast, for I haven&rsquo;t
sailed from Plymouth yet.&nbsp; Us went off in due course,
an&rsquo; I seed the wonders of the deep, an&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t
say I took to &rsquo;em; but there&mdash;I&rsquo;d gone for a
sailor, an&rsquo; a sailor I thought &rsquo;twould have to
be.&nbsp; Us got to a place by name of Barbados in the West
Indies presently&mdash;Bim for short.&nbsp; A flat pancake of an
island, with not much to tell about &rsquo;cept that
there&rsquo;s only a bit of brown paper between it an&rsquo; a
billet I hope none of us won&rsquo;t never go to.&nbsp; Hot
as&mdash;as need be, no doubt; but there was better to come, for
presently we ups anchor an&rsquo; away to St. Vincent&mdash;a
place as might make you think heaven couldn&rsquo;t be better;
an&rsquo; then down to Grenada, another island so lovely as a
fairy story; an&rsquo; then Trinidad&mdash;where the Angostura
bitters comes from, Mrs. Capern&mdash;an&rsquo; then a bit of a
place by name of Tobago, as you could put down on Dartymoor
a&rsquo;most an&rsquo; leave some to double up all round.&nbsp;
Yet, &rsquo;pon that island, neighbours, I&rsquo;ve lived my
life, an&rsquo; done my duty, I hope, an&rsquo; got well thought
upon by black, white an&rsquo; brindled; for in them islands I
should tell you the people be most every shade you could name but
green.&nbsp; Butter-coloured, treacle-coloured, putty-coloured,
saffron-coloured, <a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
283</span>peat-coloured, an&rsquo; every colour; an&rsquo;
sometimes, though a chap may have the face of a nigger&mdash;lips
an&rsquo; nose an&rsquo; wool an&rsquo; all&mdash;yet he&rsquo;ll
be so white as a dog&rsquo;s tooth; an&rsquo; you know
there&rsquo;s blood from Europe hid in him somewheres.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;m a mongrel people; yet they&rsquo;ve got
souls&mdash;just as much as they Irish-Americans; an&rsquo; God
He knows if they&rsquo;ve got souls, there&rsquo;s hope for
everything&mdash;down to a scorpion.&nbsp; My own wife, as
I&rsquo;ve left out in Tobago with my family&mdash;well, I
wouldn&rsquo;t go for to call her black; an&rsquo; for that
matter I knocked a white man off the wharf to Scarborough in
Tobago, who did say so; but you folks to home&mdash;I dare swear
you&rsquo;d think her was a thought nigger-like, owing to a touch
of the tar-brush, as we call it, long ways back in her family
history.&nbsp; But as good a woman&mdash;wife an&rsquo;
mother&mdash;as ever feared God an&rsquo; washed linen.&nbsp; A
laundress, neighbours&mdash;lower than me by her birth, so my
master said; then I laughed in his face, an&rsquo; told un I was
a workhouse boy as couldn&rsquo;t name no father but God
A&rsquo;mighty.&nbsp; A nice little bungy, round-about woman,
wi&rsquo; butivul black eyes, an&rsquo; so straight in her vartue
as a princess.&nbsp; Never a man had no better wife, an&rsquo;
her&rsquo;d have come to see old Dartymoor along with me but for
my family, as be large an&rsquo; all sizes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to Tobago it was that, lending a hand to help
lade a Royal Mail Steam Packet as <a name="page284"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 284</span>comed in&mdash;just to make a
shilling or two while we was idle, I got struck down.&nbsp;
Loading wi&rsquo; cocoanuts an&rsquo; turtle her was; an&rsquo;
&rsquo;twould make you die o&rsquo; laughin&rsquo;, souls, to
have seen them reptiles hoisted aboard by their flippers.&nbsp;
No laughing matter for them though, poor twoads, because, once
they&rsquo;m catched by moonlight &rsquo;pon the sandy beaches
there, &rsquo;tis a very poor come-along-of-it for
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; Not a bit more food do they have, but just be
shipped off home in turtle-troughs an&rsquo; make the best
weather they can.&nbsp; Us had a stormy journey back last
fortnight, an&rsquo; I knowed by the turtle-soup o&rsquo; nights
that the creatures were dying rapid an&rsquo; somebody had made a
bad bargain.&nbsp; But if you gets the varmints home alive, they
be worth a Jew&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suddenly, helping in a shore barge, I went down as if
somebody had fetched me a clout &rsquo;pon top the head;
an&rsquo;, when I came to, there was doctor from shore an&rsquo;
the dowl to pay.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas days afore I could get about,
an&rsquo; my ship couldn&rsquo;t wait, an&rsquo; no work for me
nowhere &rsquo;cept odd jobs.&nbsp; Then they told me I was a
D.B.S., which means a Distressed British Seaman, an&rsquo; I
found as I&rsquo;d have to wait for next steamer that comed to
ship me off.&nbsp; But I weren&rsquo;t very down-daunted
&rsquo;bout it, for, since I&rsquo;d seen the size of the earth,
I&rsquo;d growed bigger in the mind a bit, an&rsquo; I ate my
food an&rsquo; smoked my pipe an&rsquo; thanked God that I was
alive to try again.</p>
<p><a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
285</span>&ldquo;Then, trapesing about one afternoon, footsore
like and tired of trying to get something to do on the sugar
estates, I climbed over a wall into a bit of shade, an&rsquo; sat
me down under some cocoa trees to rest.&nbsp; I confess I did get
over a wall, which is a thing you can&rsquo;t often do without
making trouble except on old Dartymoor.&nbsp; An&rsquo; there I
was with the mountains around&mdash;all covered to their topmost
spurs wi&rsquo; wonnerful forest, and the Caribbean Sea stretched
blue as blue underneath.&nbsp; Such a jungle of trees an&rsquo;
palms laced together with flowering vines as you&rsquo;ve never
dreamed of.&nbsp; Trumpet flowers, an&rsquo; fire-red
flamboyants, an&rsquo; huge cactuses, an&rsquo; here an&rsquo;
there a lightning-blasted, gert tree towering stark white above
all the living green.&nbsp; An&rsquo; king-birds an&rsquo;
humming-birds twinkling about in the air like women&rsquo;s rings
an&rsquo; brooches, an&rsquo; lizards so big as squirrels
a-scampering upon the ground, an&rsquo; tree-frogs in the trees,
an&rsquo; fireflies spangling the velvet-black nights.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; no dimpsy light, neither at dawn nor even, for the
moment sun be down &rsquo;tis night, an&rsquo; moment he be up
again &rsquo;tis morning.&nbsp; You can see un climb straight out
o&rsquo; the sea as if he was rolling up a ladder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sat there in the shade, an&rsquo; at my very hand
what should I find but a ripe pomegranate?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a
fruit as you folks haven&rsquo;t met with outside the Bible, I
reckon, yet a real thing, an&rsquo; very nice to <a
name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 286</span>them as
like it.&nbsp; Packed tight wi&rsquo; seeds, the colour of the
heather, wi&rsquo; a bitter-sweet taste to it as be very
refreshing to the throat.&nbsp; Such a fruit I picked without
&lsquo;by your leave,&rsquo; an&rsquo; chewed at un, an&rsquo;
looked at the butivul blue sea down-under, an&rsquo; talked to
myself out loud, as my manner always was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, Bob Bates,&rsquo; I sez, &lsquo;you be
most tired o&rsquo; caddling about doing nought, ban&rsquo;t
you?&nbsp; Still, you&rsquo;m a lucky chap, whether or no; for a
live D.B.S. be a sight better&rsquo;n a dead cabin-boy.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twill larn &rsquo;e to treat the sun less civil.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t do for to cap to him in these parts.&nbsp; But you
keep up your heart an&rsquo; trust in the Lord, as Mistley told
&rsquo;e.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll look to &rsquo;e for sartain in His
own time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I heard a curious ristling alongside in the bush,
an&rsquo; catched sight of a pair o&rsquo; cat-like eyes on
me.&nbsp; &rsquo;Course I knowed there wasn&rsquo;t no savage
beasts there, but I didn&rsquo;t know as there mightn&rsquo;t be
savage men, an&rsquo; I was going to get back over thicky wall
an&rsquo; run for it.&nbsp; But too late.&nbsp; They was human
eyes, wi&rsquo; a human nose atop an&rsquo; a human moustache
under, but a very comical fashion of face an&rsquo; a queerer
than ever I&rsquo;d seen afore or have since.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis hard for me to call home exactly what
Matthew Damian looked like then, for &rsquo;tis above thirty year
ago, an&rsquo; that man filled my eye every day, winter an&rsquo;
summer, for twenty years.&nbsp; Yet, though he looks different
now, with all I know behind my <a name="page287"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 287</span>mind&rsquo;s eye as I see him, then
he &rsquo;peared mighty strange, wild an&rsquo; shaggy.&nbsp; A
face like a round shot he had, but a terrible deep jaw under the
ear.&nbsp; A little chin, round
eyes&mdash;grey-green&mdash;an&rsquo; ears standing sharp off a
close-cropped head, wi&rsquo; hair pepper-an&rsquo;-salt
colour.&nbsp; A huge, tall man, an&rsquo; his beard was cut to
his chin, an&rsquo; his moustache stuck out like a bush five
inches to port an&rsquo; starboard.&nbsp; Well, I was mortal
feared, for I&rsquo;d never seen nothing like un outside a
nightmare; yet his voice was so thin as a boy&rsquo;s, an&rsquo;
piped like a reed in his thick throat.&nbsp; He had the nigger
whine, too&mdash;as I dare say you may mark on my tongue now,
after my ears have soaked in it so long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He stared an&rsquo; I stared.&nbsp; Then he
spoke.&nbsp; &lsquo;You come along with me,&rsquo; he said in a
Frenchy sort of English.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why for?&rsquo; I said; then I thought I seed
his eyes &rsquo;pon the pomegranate.&nbsp; &lsquo;Very sorry,
sir, if this here be yours,&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;but I&rsquo;m
baggered if a chap can tell what be wild an&rsquo; what
ban&rsquo;t on this here ridicklous island.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis like
a gentleman&rsquo;s hothouse broke loose,&rsquo; I said to
un.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No matter about that,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I can give &rsquo;e my knife,&rsquo; I told un,
&lsquo;if you must have payment; but that be all I&rsquo;ve got
in the world &rsquo;cept the things I stand up in, an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;d a deal rather keep it.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
288</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;I do not want your knife,&rsquo; he
answers.&nbsp; &lsquo;I want you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going cheap, I do assure
&rsquo;e,&rsquo; I said, thinking I&rsquo;d try how a light heart
would serve me.&nbsp; But I weren&rsquo;t comfortable by a long
way, &rsquo;cause there&rsquo;s a lot of madness in them islands,
an&rsquo; I thought as this chap might be three-halfpence short
of a shilling, as we say.&nbsp; However, he was too busy thinking
to laugh at my poor fun, an&rsquo; for that matter, as I found
after, he never laughed easy,&mdash;nor talked easy for that
matter.&nbsp; Now he fell silent, an&rsquo; I walked by
him.&nbsp; Then, after a stretch through a reg&rsquo;lar Garden
of Eden, wi&rsquo;out our first parents, us comed upon a lovely
house, whitewashed home to the roof&mdash;like snow in all that
butivul green.&nbsp; &rsquo;Pon sight of it the man spoke
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I want you to talk to my mother,&rsquo; he said
suddenly.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll just talk and talk in an easy
way, as you was talking to yourself when I found you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I be only a sailor-man, wi&rsquo; nought to say
to a lady,&rsquo; I told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No matter for that,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Just talk straight on.&nbsp; It do not signify a bit what
you say, so you speak natural.&nbsp; In fact, talk to my mother
as if madame was your own mother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So then, of course, I reckoned the cat-faced chap was
out of his mind&mdash;as who wouldn&rsquo;t have?</p>
<p>&ldquo;To a great verandah we comed, all crawled over <a
name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>with the
butivulest white flowers the sun draws the scent from; an&rsquo;
there, in a cane chair, sat an ancient lady&mdash;lady, I say,
though you might have reckoned she was an old brown lizard by the
look of her.&nbsp; Old ban&rsquo;t the word for her.&nbsp;
Time&rsquo;s self would have looked a boy alongside her, if the
picture-books be true.&nbsp; A great sunbonnet was over her head,
an&rsquo; a frill under, an&rsquo; just a scanty thread or two of
white hair peeping from that.&nbsp; A face all deep lines where
the years had run over it; bright eyes peeping from behind great
gold spectacles, an&rsquo; hands&mdash;my word! like joints of an
old apple tree.&nbsp; Her was that homely too!&nbsp; A
dandy-go-risset gown her wore, an&rsquo; a bit of knitting was in
her hands, an&rsquo; a good book, wi&rsquo; very large print,
&rsquo;pon a table beside her, an&rsquo; a li&rsquo;l nigger gal
waved a fan to keep the flies away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took my hat off an&rsquo; made a leg; then her son
spoke: &lsquo;Sit down there beside her and talk loud, and
pretend with yourself that Madame Damian is your
grandmother.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t try to use fine words; and
remember this: if you do rightly as I bid you, you shall never
repent this day as long as you live.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was all in a maze, I do assure &rsquo;e; but I just
reckoned obedience was best, an&rsquo; went at her with one eye
on my gentleman, for fear as he should change his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, my old dear,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I be
very pleased to meet &rsquo;e, an&rsquo; I do like to have a tell
with &rsquo;e very <a name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
290</span>much, if you&rsquo;ll pardon a rough sailor-man.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; I hopes you&rsquo;ll put in a word with this here big
gen&rsquo;leman for me, &rsquo;cause I&rsquo;ve eat one of his
pomegranates unbeknownst-like, though I&rsquo;m shot if I&rsquo;d
have touched un come I&rsquo;d known &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t
wild.&nbsp; An&rsquo; to tell &rsquo;e gospel, I be in a jakes of
a mess as &rsquo;tis&mdash;far from my home an&rsquo; not a
friend in the world that I know of.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dallybuttons!&nbsp; To see that ancient woman!&nbsp;
When I beginned to talk, her dropped her knitting, as if there
was a spider in it, an&rsquo; sat up an&rsquo; stared out of her
bead-black eyes.&nbsp; Though &rsquo;twas a fiery day, I went so
cold as a frog all down my spine to see her glaze so keen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Go on,&rsquo; she said in a funny old voice,
&lsquo;go on, young man, will &rsquo;e?&nbsp; Tell about where
you comed from, please.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! it did sound mighty familiar to hear her,
an&rsquo; no mistake!</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My heart!&nbsp; You&rsquo;m West Country
too!&rsquo; I cried out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her nodded, but her couldn&rsquo;t speak another
word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Go on, go on talking to her,&rsquo; the man
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I sailed on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You must know I runned off to sea, ma&rsquo;am,
from a farm down Dartymoor way.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a terrible
coorious sort of a place, an&rsquo; calls for hard work if <a
name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 291</span>you wants
to thrive there.&nbsp; Roots will do if you&rsquo;m generous with
stable stuff an&rsquo; lime, but corn be cruel shy, except
oats.&nbsp; I was a lazy boy, I&rsquo;m afraid, an&rsquo; got
weary of being hit about like a foot-ball, though I deserved it;
an&rsquo; I thought to mend my life by running away.&nbsp; The
things I&rsquo;ve seed!&nbsp; Lor&rsquo;-amercy! &rsquo;tis a
wonnerful world, sure enough, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So it be,&rsquo; she said, very soft,
&lsquo;an&rsquo; a wonnerful God made it, my dear.&nbsp; Go on,
go on about the Dartymoors, will &rsquo;e?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;&rsquo;tis a gert,
lonesome land, all broke up wi&rsquo; rocky tors, as we call
&rsquo;em, an&rsquo; clitters o&rsquo; granite where the foxes
breed, an&rsquo; gashly bogs, in which you&rsquo;m like to be
stogged if you don&rsquo;t know no better.&nbsp; An&rsquo; the
cots be scattered over the face of it, an&rsquo; the little farms
do lie here an&rsquo; there in the lew corners, wi&rsquo; their
new-take fields around about.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a smell
o&rsquo; peat in the air most times, an&rsquo; it do rise up very
blue into the morning light.&nbsp; An&rsquo; the great marshes
glimmer, an&rsquo; the plovers call in spring; an&rsquo; the
ponies, wi&rsquo; their little ragged foals, go galloping unshod
over the Moor.&nbsp; Then the rivers an&rsquo; rills twinkle
every way, like silver an&rsquo; gold threads stretching miles
an&rsquo; miles; an&rsquo; come summer the heather blows
an&rsquo; the great hills shine out rosylike an&rsquo; butivul;
an&rsquo;&mdash;oh, my old dear&mdash;oh,
ma&rsquo;am&mdash;&rsquo; I says, breaking off,
&lsquo;doan&rsquo;t &rsquo;e&mdash;doan&rsquo;t &rsquo;e sob <a
name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
292</span>so&mdash;doan&rsquo;t &rsquo;e take on like that, for I
wouldn&rsquo;t bring a wisht thought to &rsquo;e for
money.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This I said &rsquo;cause the old ancient&rsquo;s lips
shook, an&rsquo; her bright eyes fell a-blinking, an&rsquo; great
tears rolled down.&nbsp; Then she put her hands over her face
an&rsquo; bowed over &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My God!&rsquo; said the chap, half to hisself,
&lsquo;this is the first time my mother have wept to my sight;
an&rsquo; I am sixty years old!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But of course a Devonshire woman wouldn&rsquo;t cry
afore a Frenchman, even if he was her son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come presently she cheered up.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do &rsquo;e
knaw a place by the name of Postbridge, my boy?&rsquo; she
says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I did ought to, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; I sez;
&lsquo;&rsquo;twas from Hartland Farm I runned.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She sighed a gert sigh.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hartland!&rsquo;
she says, as if the word was a whole hymn tune to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a church, an&rsquo; a public,
there now,&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;An&rsquo; the gert men of renown?&nbsp; Parson
Mason, an&rsquo; Mr. Slack, an&rsquo; Judge Buller, an&rsquo; Sir
Thomas Tyrwhitt?&rsquo; she axed me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Never heard tell of none of them,&rsquo; I
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Course not,&rsquo; old lady answers.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why&mdash;why, I forgot I be ninety-four.&nbsp; They
heroes was all dead afore your faither an&rsquo; mother were
born.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As to them,&rsquo; I tells her&mdash;&lsquo;as
to my faither an&rsquo; <a name="page293"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 293</span>mother, ma&rsquo;am, there&rsquo;s a
manner of grave doubt, for I&rsquo;m a workhouse boy,
wi&rsquo;out any havage that be known.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But her had fallen to dreaming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tell about the in-country,&rsquo; she said all
of a sudden.&nbsp; &lsquo;My mother comed from down Totnes
way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I tells about the South Hams, an&rsquo; the farms,
an&rsquo; the butivul apple-blooth, as creams out over the
orchards in spring, an&rsquo; all the rest of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, I talked myself dry an&rsquo; no mistake;
an&rsquo; she nodded an&rsquo; nodded an&rsquo; laughed once;
an&rsquo; it set her off coughing, an&rsquo; &rsquo;frighted her
son terrible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, after I&rsquo;d been chittering for a month of
Sundays, as it seemed to me, the day ended and it comed on dark,
an&rsquo; she got up to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Keep un here,&rsquo; she says to the man.&nbsp;
&lsquo;For God&rsquo;s love doan&rsquo;t &rsquo;e let un
go.&nbsp; Pay un anything he axes for to stop.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She went off very slow, wi&rsquo; a nigger to support
her at each elbow, an&rsquo; a fine young brown woman to look
after her.&nbsp; An&rsquo; I was took in the kitchen, an&rsquo;
had such a bellyful of meat an&rsquo; drink as minded me of
Christmas up to Hartland Farm in the old days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the chap&mdash;he lets me into the riddle of it
all.&nbsp; You see his mother was Farmer Blake&rsquo;s
darter&mdash;the first as ever saved land in these parts,
an&rsquo; rented from the Duchy more&rsquo;n a hundred years <a
name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>agone
now.&nbsp; An&rsquo; when Princetown was made for a prison to
hold the French us catched in the wars, there comed a Monseer
Damian among the prisoners.&nbsp; Him an&rsquo; many other gents
the authorities let out on parole, as they say; an&rsquo; he made
friends with Farmer Blake, an&rsquo; falled in love with Margery
Blake.&nbsp; An&rsquo; when war was done, if he didn&rsquo;t
marry her all correct an&rsquo; snatch her away to foreign
parts!&nbsp; Martinique was left to the French, an&rsquo; he took
her to that island first, then to Trinidad, which be ours, then
to Tobago, which be also ours.&nbsp; There the man prospered,
an&rsquo; growed sugar, an&rsquo; did very flourishing, an&rsquo;
comed to be first an&rsquo; richest party in the island.&nbsp;
But smallpox took him in middle life, an&rsquo; it took all his
children but his eldest son, Matthew Damian.&nbsp; He bided with
his mother, an&rsquo; married a French woman from Guadeloupe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; &rsquo;twas old lady&rsquo;s hope an&rsquo;
prayer for seventy year to hear good Devon spoke again some
day.&nbsp; Her only got to hunger terrible for the old country
when her childer an&rsquo; her husband died, by which time she
was too old to travel home again.&nbsp; An&rsquo; the Postbridge
Blakes had all gone dead ages afore; an&rsquo; in truth there
couldn&rsquo;t have been a soul on Dartymoor as remembered
her.&nbsp; Of course her son knowed the sound of the speech, from
hearing his mother, as never lost it; an&rsquo; when he catched
me telling to myself, his first thought was for her.</p>
<p><a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
295</span>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas meat an&rsquo; drink to her, sure
enough; an&rsquo; meat an&rsquo; drink to me too, for that
matter, because I never left the Man-o&rsquo;-War Bay Sugar
Estate no more.&nbsp; Very little work I done at first, for old
Mrs. Damian would have me keep on &rsquo;bout home every
afternoon in the verandah; but six months after I comed there she
died, happy as a bird; an&rsquo; if I wasn&rsquo;t down for fifty
pound in her will!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Richest people in Tobago, they was; an&rsquo; then I
settled to work for Matthew Damian, an&rsquo; when he died,
seventeen year after, the head man was pensioned off, an&rsquo; I
got the billet under Matthew Damian&rsquo;s son, who be my master
now.&nbsp; An&rsquo; there I&rsquo;ll work to the end, an&rsquo;
my childern after me, please the Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a very fine tale, Mr. Bates, if I may speak
for the company,&rdquo; said Merryweather Chugg; &ldquo;an&rsquo;
it do show what a blessing it be to come out of Devonshire.&nbsp;
If you&rsquo;d been a foreigner, now, none of these good things
would have happened to &rsquo;e.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mind my faither telling about Farmer Blake an&rsquo;
how he helped to carry his coffin to Widecombe soon after I was
born,&rdquo; said Gaffer Pearn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; declared the landlady, &ldquo;my
mind be all &rsquo;pon that poor old blid, as went away from
these parts in her maiden days.&nbsp; To think, after seventy
years of waiting, that she should hear a <a
name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 296</span>Devonshire
tongue again!&nbsp; I lay it helped her to pass in
peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did so,&rdquo; declared the returned native.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She went out of life easy as a babby; for her appeared to
see all her own folks very clear just afore she died, an&rsquo;
she was steadfast sure as there&rsquo;d be a West-Country welcome
waitin&rsquo; up-along.&nbsp; Fill your glasses, my dears;
an&rsquo; give they boys some ginger-beer, ma&rsquo;am, will
&rsquo;e?&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 297</span>THE
TWO WIDOWS</h2>
<h3><a name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
299</span>CHAPTER I</h3>
<p>Upon the great main road that crosses Dartmoor from
Moretonhampstead to Plymouth, and distant but half a mile from
the little hamlet of Postbridge, near the eastern arm of Dart,
there stand two cottages.&nbsp; Here slopes the broad bosom of
Merripit Hill upon the heart of the wilderness, and the cots,
that appear on each side of the way, are built exactly
alike&mdash;of yellow bricks and blue slates.&nbsp; They have
doors of the same green shade and window blinds of white chintz;
their woodwork is painted brown, and their chimney-pots are
red.&nbsp; In every respect these habitations seem outwardly
identical, save that one faces north, while the other, over
against it, looks southerly.&nbsp; Their gardens are of equal
proportion, and contain the same class of cabbage, similar rows
of tall scarlet-runner beans sprout from each little plot in
summer, and patches of red lettuce, dusted over with soot to keep
away the slugs, appear in both during springtime.&nbsp; Once two
men dwelt in these abodes, and they were wiser <a
name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 300</span>than their
wives and maintained an amiable acquaintance, but avoided hot
friendship.</p>
<p>When Abel Haycraft and his newly married mate arrived at the
northern-facing cottage, Henry Mogridge, the water-bailiff, who
dwelt in the cottage that looked south, paid him a visit and put
the position briefly and forcibly:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis like this, Mr. Haycraft,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I be very glad to have you for a neighbour,
an&rsquo; I hope you&rsquo;ll like Dartymoor, an&rsquo; prosper
up here, an&rsquo; make good money at Vitifer Mine, where
I&rsquo;m told you be going to work; but this I&rsquo;ll say,
don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s be too friendly&mdash;nor our women-folk
neither.&nbsp; Out of friendship I say it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a word!&rdquo; said Mr. Haycraft, who was only
twenty-one and of a sanguine nature, &ldquo;Why, I wants to be
friends with everybody, if so be as they&rsquo;ll let me.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; my missis too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very silly idea; but you&rsquo;m young
yet and will larn better come by an&rsquo; by.&nbsp; I mean this:
you an&rsquo; me live a gert deal too close together to get too
thick.&nbsp; We&rsquo;m only human beings, an&rsquo; so sure as
we get too trustful an&rsquo; too fond of listening to each
other&rsquo;s business, so sure us will end by having a mortal
row.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a thing so common as berries in a
hedge.&nbsp; I ban&rsquo;t saying a word against my old woman,
mind you.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s so truthful as light, an&rsquo; a
Christian to the marrow in her bones.&nbsp; Nor yet be I <a
name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>hinting
anything disrespectful of Mrs. Haycraft.&nbsp; Far from it.&nbsp;
But human creatures is mostly jerry-built in parts, an&rsquo; the
best have their weak spots.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nought more
dangerous on earth than a gert friendship struck up between folks
who live close together &rsquo;pon opposite sides of the
road.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seed the whole story more than once,
an&rsquo; I know what I say be true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abel Haycraft considered this statement for a moment.&nbsp;
Then he spoke:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;m right.&nbsp; An&rsquo; if by bad
chance they was to fall out&mdash;I mean the women&mdash;us would
have to take sides as a matter of duty.&nbsp; A
husband&mdash;well, there &rsquo;tis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So us would; but God forbid as our wives should have
any quarrel, or you an&rsquo; me either; so we&rsquo;ll just bide
friendly with your leave; but not too friendly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a very good plan, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo;
answered the younger; and that evening he told his wife about it
after they had gone to bed.</p>
<p>Mrs. Haycraft felt great interest and enlarged Abel&rsquo;s
vision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do &rsquo;e know what that means?&nbsp; It means as his
good lady can&rsquo;t be trusted, an&rsquo; the old man well
knows it.&nbsp; I lay she&rsquo;m the sort as makes
mischief.&nbsp; Well, don&rsquo;t you fear.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll take
care to keep her at arm&rsquo;s length.&nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t born
yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;m a kind enough creature so far, I&rsquo;m
sure,&rdquo; <a name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
302</span>answered Abel.&nbsp; &ldquo;A motherly fashion of
woman, an&rsquo; not so old as her husband by twenty years, I
should judge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas his way of giving us a warning,
nevertheless,&rdquo; declared Honor Haycraft.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Or,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;seeing as I was a red-haired
woman, and thinking maybe that I had a short temper, she may have
reckoned that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, not at all,&rdquo; interrupted the husband,
hastily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do &rsquo;e think I&rsquo;d have stood any
such idea?&nbsp; God&rsquo;s my judge, I&rsquo;d have hit the man
in the mouth if he&rsquo;d said a word against you or your
butivul colour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I thought she&rsquo;d taken a dislike to me, because
I was red, I&rsquo;d never look at the woman,&rdquo; said
Honor.&nbsp; &ldquo;For that matter, I&rsquo;m comelier far than
her, though I say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; comelier than any other woman at Postbridge,
or on all Dartymoor either,&rdquo; declared Abel, devoutly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be civil to her, then, but no more.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; I wish her hadn&rsquo;t brought over that gert dish of
Irish stew the day us comed in an&rsquo; were sinking for a
morsel to eat; for us ate it, an&rsquo; licked the bones,
an&rsquo; now she&rsquo;ve got a hold on us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said the larger-minded man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a poor spirit as can&rsquo;t stomach a kindness
without worriting to pay it back.&nbsp; Us&rsquo;ll have a chance
of <a name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 303</span>doing
her a good turn for sartain, living at her door same as we
do.&nbsp; Just let things go their own way, an&rsquo;
they&rsquo;ll go right.&nbsp; We&rsquo;m all Christian creatures,
thank God, an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s no reason because we live in a
outlandish sort of place like this here that we should forget
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; declared his plump, red girl,
pouting, &ldquo;I could wish as Mr. Mogridge hadn&rsquo;t spoke
them words.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ve hurt my pride.&nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t
going to jump down their throats.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not that
sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas a bit chilly like, perhaps; but he&rsquo;m
older than us, an&rsquo; wiser, an&rsquo; he meant
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;m not wiser than you be, anyway.&nbsp; I
believe, if us knowed, you&rsquo;d find you made better money
than what he do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Us&rsquo;ll leave it at that, then; an&rsquo; now
us&rsquo;ll go to sleep, if you please.&rdquo;</p>

304</span>CHAPTER II</h3>
<p>Within a month Honor Haycraft and Avisa Mogridge were the
closest of friends, for, despite the water-bailiff&rsquo;s
caution and the younger man&rsquo;s attempt to profit by it,
their wives took the matter into their own hands.&nbsp; Both
husbands were away all day at work; their cottages stood half a
mile distant from any others, and the two lonely women soon
struck up a close and intimate relation.&nbsp; Mrs. Mogridge was
honourable, truthful, warm-hearted and affectionate; she had two
young children, both girls; she loved her elderly husband dearly;
she knew the life-history of every man and woman in Postbridge;
and she related the affairs of the village with full detail for
the benefit of Honor, who was an Exeter girl, and did not know
the people of the Moor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can talk straight to &rsquo;e,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Mogridge, &ldquo;for you come without one particle of feeling
against anybody or for anybody.&nbsp; So I&rsquo;ll tell you what
they all be like down-along, an&rsquo; who you can trust
an&rsquo; who you can&rsquo;t trust, so far as I know
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll go your own way, but &rsquo;tis
never any harm to hear another opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus Mrs. Haycraft, instead of forming <a
name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 305</span>independent
conclusions from experience, took her view of the new neighbours
and environment from another woman; and this was a happier
circumstance than might be guessed, because Avisa Mogridge
possessed plenty of good sense and a kindly heart, whereas,
though the red girl&rsquo;s heart was warm enough, her head was
rather weak, and of sense, or patience, or knowledge of human
nature she had none to name.&nbsp; She was a superstitious woman,
full of old saws and sayings.&nbsp; If she met a single magpie,
she went in fear for a week.&nbsp; Her husband tried to laugh her
out of such folly, but he never succeeded.</p>
<p>And so the friendship ripened and the men looked on.&nbsp; In
secret Henry Mogridge prophesied a catastrophe, as sure as women
were women all the world over; while Abel Haycraft listened and
nodded, but hoped the water-bailiff might be mistaken.</p>
<p>Avisa and Honor worked side by side at the same wash-tub when
their husbands were away, compared notes, listened to each
other&rsquo;s wisdom and opinions.&nbsp; Honor petted her
friend&rsquo;s little girls, and made sugar-plums and cakes for
them; Avisa took the deepest interest in Honor&rsquo;s
approaching motherhood.</p>
<p>A boy was born to the young wife&mdash;a flaxen, Saxon atom,
with a first crop of hair the colour of straw, blue eyes, a flat
nose like his father&rsquo;s, red cheeks, and very fat limbs.</p>
<p><a name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 306</span>Then
came winter, and Henry Mogridge, catching a chill in the night
watches by the river, passed away, a victim to his duty beside
Dart.</p>
<p>Honor comforted her friend as much as might be, and Postbridge
showed sympathy also, until it was announced that Mrs. Mogridge
had been left with &pound;40 a year.&nbsp; Thereupon, feeling
that commiseration would be wasted, the village turned to more
interesting matters.</p>
<p>Time sped, and when her child was a year old, Honor Haycraft
followed Avisa into the state of widowhood.&nbsp; An accident at
Vitifer Mine ended the burly Abel&rsquo;s life; and with him
there also perished another man and a boy.</p>
<h3><a name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
307</span>CHAPTER III</h3>
<p>The two widows, united in tribulation, became greater friends
than before.&nbsp; Neither married again, and the one lived for
her little maidens, the other for her son.&nbsp; Such close amity
proved a strain at times, however, and as each knew all that
there was to know about the other, each, conscious of the
other&rsquo;s imperfections, secretly regretted them in the
friendliest spirit.&nbsp; Then came a little difference of
opinion over the children; and then, from a personal attitude of
irritation not divulged to anybody, Avisa, smarting somewhat at a
pin-prick from Honor Haycraft touching her eldest little girl,
spoke in overt fashion to a common friend at Postbridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a very good woman,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Mogridge, while she drank a dish of tea with Mrs. Bloom.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A pattern wife her was, an&rsquo; steady as time since her
man was called, an&rsquo; a pattern mother, though her goose is a
swan, as one might expect, an&rsquo; she thinks her ugly,
li&rsquo;l fat boy is a cherub, poor dear.&nbsp; Well, &rsquo;tis
natural so to do.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t blame her; we mothers be
all alike there.&nbsp; But I could wish she had more brains,
an&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t believe such a lot of rummage an&rsquo;
nonsense.&nbsp; To credit all that dead an&rsquo; gone stuff <a
name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 308</span>about
pixies, an&rsquo; the heath-hounds, an&rsquo; the use of herbs
picked in moonlight, an&rsquo; the planting of seeds &rsquo;pon a
Good Friday&mdash;why, &rsquo;tis onbecoming in a growed-up woman
as went to Sunday-school; an&rsquo; I wish she&rsquo;d drop
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was all that Avisa said to Mrs. Bloom, the washerwoman;
but a fortnight afterward it happened that by evil chance Mrs.
Bloom fell out bitterly with the water-bailiff&rsquo;s widow, and
told Mrs. Mogridge that she was a cat, and that &rsquo;twas well
known her husband never died of a chill at all, but from his
wife&rsquo;s unkindness and cruelty.&nbsp; She said a great many
other things of a nature not necessary to set down; and, as a
result, Mrs. Mogridge felt it impossible longer to affect the
society of Mrs. Bloom.</p>
<p>Then did Mrs. Bloom ask Honor Haycraft to a cup of tea; and
Honor, smarting with indignation at the treatment her dearest
friend had received from the washerwoman&rsquo;s venomous tongue,
accepted the invitation.&nbsp; Her purpose was loyal to the other
widow.&nbsp; She intended to glean further particulars concerning
Mrs. Bloom&rsquo;s abominable opinions and assertions touching
Avisa.&nbsp; Because a man in the village had told them that Mrs.
Bloom&rsquo;s statements were in the nature of a libel, and might
even put her into prison.</p>
<p>Hoping to catch Mrs. Bloom in some outrageous utterance, and
so assist her friend to crush the <a name="page309"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 309</span>washerwoman, Honor Haycraft appeared
in a cottage that always reeked of soap and steam.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bloom immediately came to personalities; and then
Honor&rsquo;s freckles stood out brown upon her red skin; she
grew hot from her heart outward; the tea lost its savour, and the
toast its charm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry am I to quarrel with any living thing&mdash;man,
woman or mouse&mdash;but one has one&rsquo;s pride,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Bloom.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ess, one has one&rsquo;s pride;
an&rsquo; if there&rsquo;s a thing I do pride myself upon, after
my gift of washing, &rsquo;tis my gift of silence.&nbsp; It
don&rsquo;t come easy to any healthy-minded woman in a village
this size to keep her mouth shut; an&rsquo; I confess that it
didn&rsquo;t come easy to me; but I larned how to do it,
an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve been a faithful friend to a gert many
people, an&rsquo; never quarrelled with a living soul, gentle or
simple, till Avisa Mogridge broke with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got a proper grudge against you,&rdquo;
said Honor, cautiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;An&rsquo; I&rsquo;m on her
side, I warn you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt: you&rsquo;ve heard her tale.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
not going to say anything about it to you, because you are her
particular friend, an&rsquo; blessed are the peacemakers.&nbsp;
But this I&rsquo;ll say, though far be it from me to set friends
against friends: I would advise you to take care.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s a fire as a very little spark will set on
light,&mdash;a very critical woman,&mdash;always was so.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a fault where there&rsquo;s no judgement.&nbsp; Her
can&rsquo;t help it.&nbsp; Her criticises other folks&rsquo;
ways, an&rsquo; their <a name="page310"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 310</span>habits, an&rsquo; their ideas,
an&rsquo; even their children.&nbsp; Now, if there is a dangerous
trick on God&rsquo;s earth, &rsquo;tis to criticise other
folks&rsquo; children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a right to her opinions,
however.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most surely she have; an&rsquo; she&rsquo;ve a right to
the air she breathes, an&rsquo; the water she drinks.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;ve a right to her ideas; but she&rsquo;s no right to
utter &rsquo;em where they might do harm.&nbsp; You an&rsquo; me
be the best friends possible, thank God, an&rsquo; she&rsquo;s no
right to say an unkind word of you to me, any more than I&rsquo;d
have a right to say an unkind word of her to you; because you
an&rsquo; she be the best friends possible likewise.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; not a word against her would ever pass my lips to you;
because you&rsquo;m a woman as feels very deeply, an&rsquo; I
should make mischief, which God forbid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her never said a word against me, that I&rsquo;ll swear
to,&rdquo; said Honor, hotly; &ldquo;an&rsquo; if an angel from
heaven told me her did, I wouldn&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; quite right you&rsquo;d be,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Bloom.&nbsp; &ldquo;You put it like a true friend.&nbsp; True
friendship be a-thought blind always; an&rsquo; &rsquo;tis well
it is so, for where there&rsquo;s clear seeing between any two
human beings, old or young, man or woman, perfect friendship
can&rsquo;t be.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve always kept my
mouth shut so close all my life; and I ban&rsquo;t going to begin
to open it now I&rsquo;m turned forty-five&mdash;not even to you,
my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
311</span>&ldquo;Not a word would I believe&mdash;not a
syllable,&rdquo; repeated Honor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; not a word would you hear from me&mdash;good
or bad.&nbsp; What she said was kindly meant&mdash;very kindly
meant indeed.&nbsp; It only showed that no two humans look at
life from the same point of view.&nbsp; We knowed that
afore.&nbsp; For my own part I&rsquo;ve always declared that
&rsquo;twas weak of you to believe all they stories of ghosts
an&rsquo; goblins, an&rsquo; dancing stones an&rsquo; the
like.&nbsp; As a deep-thinking an&rsquo; true Christian I feel
it.&nbsp; But the difference between me an&rsquo; her is that I
say it to your face; she blames you behind your back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Avisa Mogridge has laughed at me often enough about
it.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; said Honor.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
know &rsquo;tis nonsense really, but I can&rsquo;t help believing
the things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad you&rsquo;ve got the sense to see
it so.&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;no, Mrs. Mogridge,
whatever Honor Haycraft may be, she&rsquo;s not a fool.&nbsp; Her
father told her about these solemn things in her youth, an&rsquo;
many an old ancient man hereabouts do still believe in &rsquo;em,
though of course the Bible is short an&rsquo; sharp with witches
an&rsquo; such like.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t say I was a fool?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, since you ax me, I must be honest, for my own
soul&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; Trouble I won&rsquo;t make, an&rsquo;
you&rsquo;m far too sensible to think of it again.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Fool&rsquo; was not <a name="page312"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 312</span>the word she used, but she wished
you had more brains.&nbsp; That may be the same thing, or it may
not.&nbsp; I up rather sharp an&rsquo; denied you had any lack of
intellects; but she said she was in the right.&nbsp; &lsquo;Prove
it,&rsquo; I said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Prove it you can&rsquo;t, Avisa
Mogridge.&nbsp; She&rsquo;m a sensible, clever, good girl,&rsquo;
I said, &lsquo;an&rsquo; her head&rsquo;s screwed on the right
way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She bided silent a moment.&nbsp; Then she said,
&lsquo;Honor reckons her goose is a swan, an&rsquo; thinks that
her ugly, li&rsquo;l fat boy is a cherub.&rsquo;&nbsp; I stared
at her till my eyes bulged out; I couldn&rsquo;t believe my own
ears.&nbsp; She meant it, of course; but no call for you to grow
so red, my dear, she didn&rsquo;t mean it a bit unkindly.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twas just her honest opinion that your little angel be too
fat an&rsquo; too ugly for anything.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you think
that,&rsquo; I answered her, &lsquo;you&rsquo;d better not
mention it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said my li&rsquo;l boy was ugly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She thinks so.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s positive of it.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s a very honest woman, mind you.&nbsp; With all her
many faults, she&rsquo;s honest.&nbsp; She wouldn&rsquo;t have
said it if she hadn&rsquo;t really believed it.&nbsp; She&rsquo;m
dead certain of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Billy ugly!&nbsp; Did &rsquo;e ever set eyes on a
finer babby, tell me that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&nbsp; I never seed such a purty child in all my
life.&nbsp; He&rsquo;m a like a li&rsquo;l blue-eyed Love off a
valentine.&nbsp; But she&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
313</span>&ldquo;A woman who could say my child was ugly could
only say it for malice,&rdquo; declared the red-haired mother,
with a rising breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think that.&nbsp; Her own maidens be very
homely, you see.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a little natural jealousy,
be-like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a lie, Jane Bloom, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
never believe she said it&mdash;never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be sorry for that word, Honor
Haycraft.&nbsp; Ax her, then.&nbsp; Ax her if her didn&rsquo;t
tell me your little boy was fat an&rsquo; ugly.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
never been catched out in a lie yet, &rsquo;tis said.&nbsp; See
what she&rsquo;ll answer you.&nbsp; An&rsquo; when you&rsquo;ve
heard her speak, I shall expect you to say you&rsquo;m sorry to
me.&nbsp; I never yet willingly uttered an unkind word against
any living soul, an&rsquo; never will.&nbsp; If you want to live
in a fool&rsquo;s paradise, that&rsquo;s your lookout.&nbsp; But
it shall never be said I didn&rsquo;t do my duty to my neighbour
according to the Prayer Book ordinance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this vague but masterly speech Mrs. Bloom rose from her
tea and held the cottage door open.&nbsp; Her guest took the
hint, and in ten minutes was at home again.</p>
<p>Then she crossed the road, and seeing Avisa Mogridge in her
garden with the little girls and the infant Billy, who had been
left in trust with her, Honor spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just one word, an&rsquo; only one, afore I go down to
<a name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 314</span>the
village an&rsquo; give that old cat-a-mountain, Jane Bloom, the
lie to her crooked face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; What have she said, then?&rdquo; asked the
other.&nbsp; Mrs. Mogridge rose from pulling up weeds, and lifted
her shoulders to ease her back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ve told me as you told her that my child was
fat an&rsquo; ugly.&nbsp; I answered in one word that she was a
wicked liar.&nbsp; An&rsquo; she answered back that I&rsquo;d
better ax you, for you&rsquo;d never been known to tell a
falsehood in all your born days.&nbsp; Did you say it or
didn&rsquo;t you, Avisa?&nbsp; I only want your word.&nbsp; Then
I&rsquo;ll go back-along and give her what for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Mogridge paused with a bit of groundsel in her
hand.&nbsp; The children frolicked beside her, and she bade them
be silent, sharply.&nbsp; Then she dropped the groundsel and
turned and spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you that you was wrong to go an&rsquo; speak to
her.&nbsp; I warned you against it.&nbsp; Now, I suppose, the
fat&rsquo;s in the fire.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d made me cross a
fortnight agone, when you said that my Minnie&rsquo;s second
teeth would never come right.&nbsp; An&rsquo; I got talking like
a fool just afterward, an&rsquo; I certainly said to Mrs. Bloom
that your goose was a swan&mdash;same as it is with all of us
mothers&mdash;an&rsquo; I said that your little, dear boy
was&mdash;was ugly.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t a right or a kind
thing to say, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m very&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said it!&nbsp; An&rsquo; like enough you&rsquo;ve
said it a thousand times.&nbsp; You&rsquo;m a wicked traitor;
an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll <a name="page315"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 315</span>never speak to you again, so help me
God; an&rsquo; if your beastly childer cross my threshold any
more, or so much as touch my garden palings, I&rsquo;ll throw
boiling water over &rsquo;em, so now you know, you evil-minded,
jealous devil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Haycraft spoke no more, and waited for no answer.&nbsp;
She snatched up her child, rushed into her own house, banged the
door and was soon sobbing over her fat-nosed Billy.</p>
<h3><a name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
316</span>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<p>When Jane Bloom&rsquo;s husband took his lady out of
Postbridge, so that she might live down a connubial scandal and
pursue her cleansing occupation elsewhere, it was supposed that
the deadly and famous quarrel between Avisa and Honor would be
healed.&nbsp; The gossips of Postbridge all prophesied a speedy
return to friendship between the two widows, and not a few
well-meaning women set to work to play peacemaker.&nbsp; But
their efforts met no response.&nbsp; Both Avisa and Honor made it
clear that arbitration must be in vain, since this tragic matter
went deeper than plummet of peacemaker could ever sound.&nbsp;
Neither woman would make the first move; but Mrs. Mogridge was
prepared to welcome any overture from the other.&nbsp; She
accepted the inevitable with considerable philosophy; rightly
appreciated the significance of the position; perceived how the
idlest, least malignant word may sometimes fall like a scourge
upon the back of the careless speaker.&nbsp; She held herself
punished, and quite deservedly punished, for a very foolish
error.&nbsp; She mourned the event, and with secret tears
recalled the wisdom of her dead partner.&nbsp; Mrs. <a
name="page317"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 317</span>Haycraft,
on the other hand, nursed her wrath and kept it warm.&nbsp; Her
little boy justified the bygone criticism, and he grew less and
less personable.&nbsp; But how could she know that?&nbsp; To her
eyes he was beautiful above the children of men.&nbsp; Daily he
grew more like his father; daily his little weak eyes reflected
more of the blue of the sky.</p>
<p>Then he fell very sick and died.</p>
<p>A night of agony hid Honor, and in that darkness her tears
descended like winter rain.&nbsp; Hopeless, helpless, red-eyed,
she sat by the small body; and women came to comfort her, but she
cursed both God and them, and bade them depart and leave her
alone with grief greater than daughter of man had yet
suffered.</p>
<p>The day before the funeral the mother took no food, and
entered upon that nervous, neurotic period common to the
time.&nbsp; She never sat down.&nbsp; She roamed for miles in the
narrow space of the house and garden.&nbsp; She arranged and
rearranged the flowers on the coffin; she magnified small griefs
and temporary inconveniences.&nbsp; She quarrelled bitterly with
the undertaker that the lining of the little box was cheaper than
she had directed.&nbsp; She found a small flaw also upon the
lid.&nbsp; This was concealed with putty, and Honor called down
the wrath of the Everlasting upon the carpenter who had made
it.</p>
<p>A master sorrow in the minor sort now fell <a
name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 318</span>upon
her.&nbsp; There is a belief on Dartmoor that if a little boy
dies, he should be carried to his grave by little girls, and when
a small maid passes it is thought good if boys are her
bearers.&nbsp; Honor hugged this tradition as a precious and
seemly observance; but it chanced that of small girls in
Postbridge there were then but four, and the task she desired to
set them would need six pairs of hands.&nbsp; The misfortune
swiftly mounted into a tragedy when viewed from her distracted
standpoint.&nbsp; Her unrestrained grief grew voluble; she
mourned her lot to any who would listen.&nbsp; From the first
storm of weeping and the first desire for peace and loneliness
she became talkative, and, in a condition of sustained
incoherence, chattered, light-headed, from morning until
night.&nbsp; She was rude to the clergyman when he came to see
her.&nbsp; Her friends suggested that two more little girls
should be obtained from Princetown, or some neighbouring hamlet;
but the poor soul explained that this rite allowed of no such
deviation.&nbsp; The children must be those who had known her
dead baby, and actually played with him.&nbsp; Others would not
answer the proper purpose.</p>
<p>Upon the night before the funeral the undertaker went home a
shattered man, for the matter of this tiny corpse had troubled
him, and such failure to satisfy the parent hurt his professional
feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t half the difficulties when us laid
<a name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 319</span>by His
Honour, Lord Champernowne, Peer of the Realm and J.P., an&rsquo;
ten coaches, an&rsquo; a letter of thanks after from the
steward,&rdquo; he grumbled to his wife.&nbsp; But she comforted
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The woman&rsquo;s stark, staring mad, my dear.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t think no more about her.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;d lined
the casket with shining gold, her&rsquo;d have grumbled because
there weren&rsquo;t no diamonds in it.&nbsp; An&rsquo; all for
two pound, ten.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas like your big heart to use elm,
when any other man would have made deal do very nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meantime, at the hour of gloaming, as Dartmoor vanished fold
upon fold into the purple of night, did Avisa Mogridge pluck
heart, and cross the high road, and enter her neighbour&rsquo;s
house.&nbsp; She did not knock, but lifted the latch boldly,
walked in and stood before Honor, where the unhappy mother sat
and worked upon a black bonnet by candle-light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&nbsp; You to come!&nbsp; You, as may be a witch
an&rsquo; overlooked my li&rsquo;l darling, for all I
know!&rdquo; she cried, leaping to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, &rsquo;tis me, Mrs. Haycraft; but no witch.&nbsp;
Only a woman as have seed sorrow too&mdash;though no sorrow like
your sorrow just now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve come to tell &rsquo;e I
love &rsquo;e still, an&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t bide away from
&rsquo;e no more, an&rsquo; I won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; You shan&rsquo;t
drive me off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Honor breathed hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything do happen all to once,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p><a name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
320</span>&ldquo;Maybe I didn&rsquo;t ought to have intruded; but
I&rsquo;m older than you, an&rsquo; I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You be safe.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m too weak to bear malice
against you.&nbsp; My darling&rsquo;s screwed down now.&nbsp; If
you&rsquo;d seed him yesterday, you&rsquo;d have called back your
wicked word, Avisa Mogridge.&nbsp; He weren&rsquo;t ugly after he
died&mdash;he&mdash;oh, God, an&rsquo; not one sound of his
little noise in the house.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s killing
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be frank with you, Honor, you must marry
again.&nbsp; You&rsquo;m only twenty-three.&nbsp; Yes, I know you
be.&nbsp; An&rsquo; &rsquo;twas my little girls put them flowers
&rsquo;pon your window-sill last June on your birthday
morning.&nbsp; They done it afore daybreak.&nbsp;
An&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;oh, woman, I be broken-hearted
for &rsquo;e; God&rsquo;s my judge if I ban&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Haycraft was rocking herself backward and forward, and
crying.</p>
<p>Suddenly she rose up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come an&rsquo; see the coffin,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Several of the gentry have sent greenhouse flowers to
me.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a butivul smell to &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will come; an&rsquo; I want to say this.&nbsp; My
girls&mdash;do &rsquo;e let &rsquo;em help with the thing you
want.&nbsp; They&rsquo;d make six with t&rsquo;other
children.&nbsp; Do &rsquo;e let &rsquo;em, Honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis too late; they can&rsquo;t get black
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget my old mother died last
Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
321</span>&ldquo;Ah! so her did&mdash;that&rsquo;s lucky,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Haycraft.</p>
<p>After the funeral the widows walked together.&nbsp; They left
their friends at Postbridge, then returned home side by side.</p>
<p>As they ascended the hill, with Avisa&rsquo;s two little girls
marching together behind them, a robin suddenly sang out sharp
and clear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank the Lord I&rsquo;ve heard that,&rdquo; said
Honor, very earnestly, alluding to an ancient fable.</p>
<p>Her reconciled friend nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be very glad also,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;To
hear redbreast singing after a child is buried do mean the little
one&rsquo;s safe in Heaven; though, all the same, God only knows
where the babbies should go to, if not to Him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On a frosty night, when George III was King, certain men, for
the most part familiar customers, sat in the bar of the
&ldquo;Golden Anchor,&rdquo; Daleham; and amongst them appeared
that welcome addition to the usual throng: a stranger.&nbsp; For
his benefit old tales were told anew and ancient memories
ransacked; because this West country fishing village enjoyed rich
encrustation of legend and romance, and boasted a roll call of
great names and great deeds.&nbsp; Here dwelt the spirits of
bygone free-traders, visible by night in the theatre of their
lawless enterprises; and here even more notable stories, touching
more notable phantoms, might also be gleaned from ancient
intelligencers at the time of evening drinking.</p>
<p>The newcomer listened grimly to matters now much exercising
Daleham.&nbsp; He was a hard-faced man with a blue chin and black
eyes, whose short, double-breasted jacket, wide breeches, glazed
hat and pigtail marked a seafarer.</p>
<p><a name="page326"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
326</span>&ldquo;As for ghostes,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;can&rsquo;t swear I&rsquo;ve ever seed one, but no
sailor-man, as have witnessed the Lord&rsquo;s wonders in the
deep, would dare to doubt &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just picture a whole throng, my dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Cramphorn spoke.&nbsp; He was an ancient fisher, and his
face might have stood for the Apostle Peter&rsquo;s; but it quite
gave the lie to his character, for this venerable man was hand in
glove with the smugglers, had himself been a free-trader of
renown, and now very gladly placed his wit and experience at the
command of the younger generation.&nbsp; No word was ever
whispered against him openly, and yet the rumour ran that Johnny
had his share of every cargo successfully run upon these coasts,
and that he was the guiding spirit ashore, while &ldquo;Merry
Jonathan,&rdquo; or Jonathan Godbeer of Daleham, captained on the
water that obscure body known as the Daleham free-traders.</p>
<p>With such a sailor as Jonathan afloat and such a wise-head as
Mr. Cramphorn at home, the local smugglers earned a measure of
fame that reached even to the Revenue.&nbsp; Indeed, at the
moment of this story&rsquo;s opening, the little fishing village,
with uneasy pride, was aware that a Preventive Officer had been
appointed for its especial chastisement and control; but none
feared the issue.&nbsp; Every woman and child at Daleham knew
that it would <a name="page327"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
327</span>task men of uncommon metal with hard heads and thick
skulls to lay their local champions by the heels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ess,&rdquo; said the white-bearded Cramphorn,
&ldquo;ghostes of men an&rsquo; ghostes of hosses tu.&nbsp;
Ban&rsquo;t many parishes as can shaw &rsquo;e such a brave
turnout of holy phantoms, I lay.&nbsp; You might have seed that
ruin in the fir trees &rsquo;pon top of the cliff as you comed
down the hill p&rsquo;raps?&nbsp; Wheer the fishermen&rsquo;s
gardens be.&nbsp; Well, &rsquo;twas a famous mansion in the old
days, though now sinked to a mere landmark for mackerel
boats.&nbsp; But the Stapledons lived theer in times agone,
an&rsquo; lorded it awver all the land so far as Dartymouth,
&rsquo;tis thought.&nbsp; Of course they died like theer
neighbours, an&rsquo; many a brave funeral passed out-along wheer
I grow my bit of kale to-day.&nbsp; Yet no account taken till
theer comed the terrible business of Lady Emma
Stapledon&mdash;poor soul.&nbsp; Her was ordered by her
cold-hearted faither to marry a Lunnon man for his money&mdash;a
gay young youth of gert renown, an&rsquo; as big a rip as ever
you see, an&rsquo; a very evil character, but thousands of pounds
in the bank to soften people&rsquo;s minds.&nbsp; Her
wouldn&rsquo;t take him, however, an&rsquo; peaked an&rsquo;
pined, till at last&mdash;two nights afore the
marriage-day&mdash;her went out alone along that dangerous edge
of cliff what be named the Devil&rsquo;s Tight-rope.&nbsp; In
charity us&rsquo;ll say the poor maiden&rsquo;s foot slipped,
though if it did, <a name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
328</span>why for should her funeral walk ever since when January
comes round?&nbsp; Anyway it shows her had Christian burial no
doubt, an&rsquo; the funeral can be seen evermore&mdash;hosses
an&rsquo; men, hearse an&rsquo; coffin.&nbsp; Every moony night
in January it may be marked stealin&rsquo; like a fog awver the
tilth by the old road from the ruined gates; an&rsquo; to see it
only axes a pinch of faith in the beholder.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
watched it scores o&rsquo; dozens o&rsquo; times&mdash;all so
black as sin an&rsquo; silent as the grave.&nbsp; My sweat falled
like rain fust time I seed it, but I minded how the Lord looks
arter His awn.&nbsp; Of course an honest, church-going
man&rsquo;s out o&rsquo; the reach o&rsquo; ghostes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Cramphorn stopped and buried his beautiful Roman nose in
some rum and water.&nbsp; Then Mrs. Pearn, mistress of the
&ldquo;Golden Anchor,&rdquo; mended the fire, and a man, sitting
in the ingle, asked a question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Jenifer to?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis late for her
to be out alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman answered:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone up the hill for green stuff.&nbsp; Her laughs at
all you silly men.&nbsp; I told her how &rsquo;twas the time for
Lady Emma&rsquo;s death-coach; but her said so long as they
didn&rsquo;t want her to get in an&rsquo; sit along wi&rsquo;
she, her&rsquo;d not mind no death-coaches, nor ghostes
neither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis very unseemly for a maid to talk so,&rdquo;
<a name="page329"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 329</span>declared
the stranger, gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;Them as flout spirits often
have to pay an ugly reckoning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Others were also of this mind and Mr. Cramphorn gave
instances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My stars!&nbsp; You&rsquo;m makin&rsquo; me cream with
fear, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Mrs. Pearn, after supping full
on their horrid recollections; &ldquo;best to go up the hill,
Jonathan Godbeer, an&rsquo; find the wench.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis your
work, seeing you&rsquo;m tokened to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger started and cast a sharp glance where sat the man
addressed.&nbsp; Merry Jonathan was a tall and square-built
sailor with a curly head and an eye that looked all people
squarely in the face.&nbsp; A crisp beard served to hide his true
expression, and the cloak of a smile, usually to be found upon
his lips, concealed the tremendous determination of his
countenance.&nbsp; Indeed he habitually hid behind a mask of loud
and somewhat senseless laughter.&nbsp; But those who served him
at his secret work and in times of peril, knew a different
Jonathan, not to be described as &ldquo;Merry.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now
the man rose and grinned at the stranger amiably until his grey
eyes were quite lost in rays of crinkled skin.&nbsp; He
out-stared the other seafarer, as he made it a rule to out-stare
all men; then he prepared to obey his future mother-in-law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mustn&rsquo;t let my sweetheart be drove daft
by&mdash;&rdquo; he began, when the inn door opened and a girl,
<a name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 330</span>with her
hair fallen down her back and a terrified white face, appeared
and almost dropped into Godbeer&rsquo;s arms.&nbsp; &ldquo;Gude
powers!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the matter, my dear maid?&rdquo; he
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who&rsquo;ve hurt &rsquo;e?&nbsp;
Who&rsquo;ve dared?&nbsp; Tell your Jonathan an&rsquo;
he&rsquo;ll smash the man like eggshells&mdash;if &rsquo;tis a
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenifer clung to him hysterically and her teeth
chattered.&nbsp; They took her to the fire and her mother brought
a tumbler of spirits and water at Mr. Cramphorn&rsquo;s
direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh my God, I knawed how &rsquo;twould be,&rdquo; wailed
the old woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Her&rsquo;ve seed what her
didn&rsquo;t ought, an&rsquo; now her&rsquo;ll suffer for
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenifer was on her lover&rsquo;s lap by the fire and tears at
last came to her eyes.&nbsp; Then she wept bitterly and found her
tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put your arm around me,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;close&mdash;close&mdash;Jonathan.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seed
it&mdash;Lady Emma&rsquo;s death-coach&mdash;creeping awver the
frozen ground up-along.&nbsp; It passed wi&rsquo;in ten yards of
where I was cutting cabbages, an&rsquo; never such cold I
felt.&nbsp; It have got to my heart an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
die&mdash;I knaw it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might have been mistook, young woman,&rdquo; said
the blue-muzzled man, civilly; but she shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gert hearse wi&rsquo; feathers an&rsquo; a tall man
in front, an&rsquo; four hosses all blacker&rsquo;n the fir-wood
they comed from.&nbsp; An&rsquo; the moonlight shone through
&rsquo;em where <a name="page331"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
331</span>they moved away to the churchyard; an&rsquo; I fainted,
I reckon, then come to an&rsquo; sped away afore they
returned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d have been there again in an hour or
two,&rdquo; declared old Cramphorn.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the
way of it.&nbsp; Ten o&rsquo;clock or so they sets out, an&rsquo;
back they come by midnight or thereabouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the stranger rose to retire, but before doing so he
declared his identity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may tell you, neighbours, that I be the Preventive
Officer sent to work along with the cutter from Dartmouth.&nbsp;
My name be Robert Bluett, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m an old
man-o&rsquo;-war&rsquo;s man an&rsquo; a West countryman
likewise.&nbsp; An&rsquo; I look to every honest chap amongst
&rsquo;e to help me in the King&rsquo;s name against
lawbreakers.&nbsp; So all&rsquo;s said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A murmur ran through the company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Question is what be honest an&rsquo; what
ban&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Things ban&rsquo;t dishonest &rsquo;cause
Parliament says so,&rdquo; growled a long-faced, sour man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Free tradin&rsquo;s the right answer to wrongful laws,
an&rsquo; &rsquo;tis for them up-along to mend Justice, not rob
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jonathan Godbeer, however, stoutly applauded Mr. Bluett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be just a simple fisherman myself,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;but what I can do against they French rascals I will
do.&nbsp; You may count upon me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bluett regarded Johnny Cramphorn and saw <a
name="page332"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 332</span>that the
patriarch&rsquo;s eyes were fixed on Godbeer and full of
amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You to say that!&rdquo; he murmured,
&ldquo;you&mdash;when us all knows&mdash;but ban&rsquo;t no
business of mine, thank the Lord.&nbsp; At least you may count
upon an old man to stand by the King and his lawful laws, same as
I always have and always will so long as I be spared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Riotous laughter greeted these noble sentiments, and Bluett,
vaguely aware that the company laughed as much with the ancient
as at him, departed to bed.&nbsp; He was staying at the
&ldquo;Golden Anchor&rdquo; until his lodgment at Daleham should
be ready for him.</p>
<h3><a name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
333</span>CHAPTER II</h3>
<p>Great confusion, shouting and swearing kept Robert Bluett
wakeful for some time, and next morning he learned the reason of
it.&nbsp; As he walked early upon the quay before breakfast,
tried to master the intricate coast-line at a glance and longed
to be afloat that he might get a wider and juster view of the red
and honeycombed cliffs, a woebegone figure approached him&mdash;a
bent and hobbling creature that crawled on two sticks, wore a
three-cornered hat and had his right eye concealed by a big black
patch.&nbsp; Only the flowing beard of Johnny Cramphorn
proclaimed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God save you, Master Bluett, or I should say
&lsquo;Cap&rsquo;n Bluett,&rsquo;&rdquo; he began.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The very man I wanted for to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s been clawing you?&rdquo; asked the Excise
Officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who but the Dowl&rsquo;s own anointed?&nbsp; You heard
the tantara in the tap-room?&nbsp; Well, &rsquo;twas upon an aged
piece like me they varmints falled like heathen wolves.&nbsp;
Look here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lifted his patch and showed a pale blue eye <a
name="page334"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 334</span>set in a
bruise as black as ink.&nbsp; Thus seen it suggested a
jackdaw&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jonathan Godbeer&rsquo;s hand done that&mdash;the Lord
judge un!&nbsp; Wi&rsquo; his bullock&rsquo;s fist he knocked me
down, &rsquo;cause I withstood un to his face, like the prophet
withstood David.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ban&rsquo;t no quarrel of mine,&rdquo; said Mr. Bluett,
&ldquo;though if all I hear be true, me an&rsquo; Godbeer may
fall out afore the world&rsquo;s much older.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ess&mdash;if you&rsquo;m honest, you&rsquo;ll fall out
wi&rsquo; him.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas honesty brought me these cruel
bruises.&nbsp; When you&rsquo;d gone, I rose in my wrath
an&rsquo; axed un how he dared to lie to you so open; then he
smote me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bluett&rsquo;s natural probity here led him into
unwisdom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be plain,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
heard no very good account of you neither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, &rsquo;tis so hard to get away from one&rsquo;s
sins!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be honest, Cap&rsquo;n, same as you
be,&rdquo; answered Mr. Cramphorn.&nbsp; &ldquo;I doan&rsquo;t
deny but I&rsquo;ve been a free-trader in my time, though
&rsquo;twas little enough ever I made by it but a score on the
wrong side of the Book o&rsquo; Life.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ve long
been weary of ill-doing and be set &rsquo;pon the right road this
many years, as Parson Yates will tell &rsquo;e.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas
for the cause of right I got these blows&mdash;same as Paul his
stripes&mdash;an&rsquo; though I&rsquo;ve been that man&rsquo;s
friend in time past, now I&rsquo;m gwaine to take vengeance <a
name="page335"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 335</span>against un,
an&rsquo; next time I hears tell of his games, you&rsquo;ll be
the fust to know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will suit me very well,&rdquo; answered
Bluett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; I ax you to back me up an&rsquo; protect me
henceforth in the King&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; continued
Johnny.&nbsp; &ldquo;To think of a man as would wallop an old
blid like me!&nbsp; No better&rsquo;n a murderer&mdash;there he
is now!&nbsp; Doan&rsquo;t you go away from me till he&rsquo;ve
passed us by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jonathan Godbeer walked along the quay to the boats.&nbsp; He
scowled at old Cramphorn and touched his hat to the officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marnin&rsquo;, sir!&nbsp; I see thicky old rat have got
&rsquo;e by the ear.&nbsp; I thrashed un last night, ancient
though he be, for calling me a smuggler afore the company;
an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll thrash un every time he dares to do the
like.&nbsp; Take care how you put your trust in him, for the
Faither of Lies be a fule to that man.&nbsp; He never done nobody
a gude turn in&rsquo;s life; though he&rsquo;ll get a gude turn
yet hisself when the cart goes from under him an&rsquo; leaves
him dancin&rsquo; &rsquo;pon a rope.&nbsp; I warn &rsquo;e
against un for all his white beard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jonathan grinned at his own prophecy and departed; Cramphorn
shook his fist and chattered curses; and Mr. Bluett went upon
this way.&nbsp; He was puzzled but not ill-pleased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When thieves fall out, honest men come by theer
own,&rdquo; he reflected, and returned to breakfast.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page336"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
336</span>Jenifer Pearn waited upon him at his meal and took
occasion to give Mr. Bluett yet another version of the brawl that
had troubled his slumbers over night; but as she loved Merry
Jonathan, her story redounded little to the smuggler&rsquo;s
discredit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They all want to be your friends,&rdquo; she explained;
&ldquo;but, except my Jonathan, theer ban&rsquo;t a pin to choose
among &rsquo;em.&nbsp; He&rsquo;m honest as daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bluett thereupon changed the subject and trusted that
Jenifer was none the worse for her fright.&nbsp; The girl had a
dark, keen face, was built generously and evidently enjoyed
unusual physical strength for a woman.&nbsp; Yet the old sailor
recollected that she had been no more than a pleasant armful for
her future husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be well again,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;yet I wish I
hadn&rsquo;t seen no such dreadful contrivance, I&rsquo;m
sure.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a very sad thing, an&rsquo; mother sez how
Parson Yates did ought to be axed to faace they phantoms in the
name of the Lord wi&rsquo; a bell, a book an&rsquo; a cannel,
&rsquo;cordin&rsquo; to the right an&rsquo; holy way in such
matters.&nbsp; But Gran&rsquo;faither Newte an&rsquo; Toby Pearn,
my great-uncle, an&rsquo; a gude few other auld parties say that
Lady Emma&rsquo;s funeral be the chiefest glory of Daleham
an&rsquo; &rsquo;twould be a thousand pities to go an&rsquo; lay
it wi&rsquo; a bit of parson&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer was interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think if the poor
soul <a name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
337</span>killed herself two hundred years ago, &rsquo;tis time
her was laid peaceful an&rsquo; reg&rsquo;lar as by law
appointed.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis all us can do for ghostes; to lay
&rsquo;em; an&rsquo; even then it axes a clergyman.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; the holiest have got to mind theer <i>p</i>&rsquo;s
an&rsquo; <i>q</i>&rsquo;s, for, make a mistake, an&rsquo; so
like as not they&rsquo;m tored to pieces for their
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not hear tell no more about it,&rdquo;
answered Jenifer, shivering and looking uneasily about her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But this I knaw; Parson Yates ban&rsquo;t the man for the
job&mdash;so meek as Moses he be, an&rsquo; would run from a
goose, let alone a ghostey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If &rsquo;tis proved his duty, he&rsquo;ve got to faace
it, however,&mdash;same as all of us has got to faace our
duty,&rdquo; declared Mr. Bluett.</p>
<h3><a name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
338</span>CHAPTER III</h3>
<p>A week elapsed and the tragic dispute between Merry Jonathan
and his ancient ally grew into a nine days&rsquo; wonder.&nbsp;
That the new-come representative of law was responsible for their
quarrel none doubted, for Mr. Bluett had arrived in an hour not
auspicious from the smugglers&rsquo; standpoint.&nbsp; He was at
Daleham a fortnight earlier than most people expected him, and
the presence of himself and his mates had threatened directly to
interfere with greater matters than he guessed.&nbsp; Yet the
secret of a cargo, its arrival nigh Daleham and the hour and
place, now came frankly into Robert Bluett&rsquo;s keeping, since
old Cramphorn&mdash;his friendship turned to gall under
Godbeer&rsquo;s heavy hands&mdash;for once followed the
unfamiliar paths of rectitude.&nbsp; So, at least, he declared to
the Exciseman, though even Mr. Bluett, whose mind was cast in
simple mould, perceived that a private hatred and a private
grudge were responsible for the patriarch&rsquo;s treachery,
rather than any desire to do right.&nbsp; It was mention of his
former partner that always stung old Johnny into passion, made
his beard shake and his voice go shrill and cracked.</p>
<p><a name="page339"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
339</span>&ldquo;A mighty haul of French
fishes&mdash;brandy&mdash;baccy&mdash;lace an&rsquo; such like;
an&rsquo; now I&rsquo;m a changed man an&rsquo; shall take no
part,&rdquo; he explained to his new friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Theer&rsquo;s foreign fal-lals &rsquo;bout that young
woman to the inn,&rdquo; said Mr. Bluett.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stuff that
never comed honest about her neck, I&rsquo;ll swear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His gift.&nbsp; They&rsquo;m tokened, though God send
you&rsquo;ll lay un by the heels an&rsquo; show her the mistake
she&rsquo;m makin&rsquo; in time.&nbsp; An&rsquo; now listen, for
I doan&rsquo;t want to be seen with you in public no more.&nbsp;
When I quarrelled with the man,&mdash;Godbeer,&mdash;I knowed
he&rsquo;d change the appointed date; an&rsquo; sure enough he
did so.&nbsp; But theer&rsquo;s wan hand of his crew&mdash;no
call to name names&mdash;who be on my side; an&rsquo; he&rsquo;ve
told me the real date.&nbsp; Which that is Wednesday next, if
this here northeast wind holds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the day I be taking my men to
Dartmouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;you think Merry Jonathan doan&rsquo;t know
that?&nbsp; He knows everything.&nbsp; He knows I be
talkin&rsquo; to &rsquo;e now; but he doan&rsquo;t know what
I&rsquo;ve told &rsquo;e; and he&rsquo;d be ravin&rsquo; mad if
he did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Us mustn&rsquo;t go to Dartmouth then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No fay!&nbsp; But you must let him think you
have.&nbsp; You must start by day an&rsquo; get back after dusk
an&rsquo; lie by the cliff roads&mdash;some of your chaps by
each; for theer ban&rsquo;t no other ways up.&nbsp; An&rsquo; the
<a name="page340"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
340</span>Dartymouth cutter must slip out the moment after dimpsy
light; an&rsquo; wi&rsquo; any luck you&rsquo;ll take the
Frenchman tu.&nbsp; Of course Wednesday be the day Cap&rsquo;n
Wade always sails west wi&rsquo; the cutter.&nbsp; He&rsquo;m
such a man of method that the smugglers know to a mile wheer the
fool be, so reg&rsquo;lar as they know moon an&rsquo;
tides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll change all that,&rdquo; declared Bluett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; best begin Wednesday; an&rsquo; you must
swear on your dying oath my name doan&rsquo;t come out.&nbsp; For
Jonathan would swing for me, so cheerful as a flea, if he heard
I&rsquo;d informed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer regarded Johnny with stern contempt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dirty work of the world have got to be done;
an&rsquo; your breed never dies,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re not nice, but you&rsquo;re needful&mdash;like
vultures an&rsquo; jackals as I&rsquo;ve seed around foreign
ports.&nbsp; No, I&rsquo;ll not name you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to reward?&nbsp; Theer&rsquo;s my friend tu, as have
told me the secret.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis right us should get our
deserts for smashing that cowardly dog.&nbsp; An&rsquo; God, He
knows how poor I be.&nbsp; But theer&rsquo;ll be a thousand
golden guineas in it for you, so like as not; an&rsquo; if you
take the foreigner, her&rsquo;ll be worth a Jew&rsquo;s-eye, for
she&rsquo;s a butivul thing by all accounts, though if the cutter
catches her &rsquo;twill be by stealth, not
sailin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twould make a stir,&rdquo; admitted the other,
<a name="page341"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
341</span>cautiously.&nbsp; Then a sudden wave of suspicion
crossed his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re lying to me, you&rsquo;ll repent
it,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Judge by what I lose,&rdquo; retorted the old man,
almost tearfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;To put this harvest into your
hands is to rob my own pocket.&nbsp; Baccy an&rsquo; winter
drinkin&rsquo;&mdash;I give up all for the hate I bear against
that man.&nbsp; But take my word or leave it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Cramphorn&rsquo;s bitterness of expression and the lean
fist raised and shaken at Merry Jonathan&rsquo;s empty boat hard
by, went far to convince Mr. Bluett.&nbsp; That day he hired a
horse and rode over to Dartmouth and in the evening met his
secret accomplice again among the usual crowd at the bar of the
&ldquo;Golden Anchor.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jonathan Godbeer was not
present, but the rest of the company now knew the officer by name
and treated him with outward civility and respect.</p>
<p>The conversation ran on Lady Emma&rsquo;s death-coach.&nbsp;
Even Parson Yates had been awakened from his abstracted existence
by the reports of this singular apparition, for many had seen it
of late and not a few fearfully approached their pastor upon the
subject.&nbsp; That evening, indeed, the folk awaited news of
some definite decision from Daleham&rsquo;s spiritual leader,
because, as Jenifer Pearn told the Exciseman, though certain
ancient celebrities had objected to interference with a vision so
historical, <a name="page342"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
342</span>others held it a scandal that any patrician
maiden&rsquo;s spirit should thus continue to revisit the scenes
of her life and taking off.&nbsp; Greater matters occupied Robert
Bluett&rsquo;s mind, but, sailor-like, he loved a ghost, and his
life had not changed the superstitious nature of him.&nbsp; He
listened with the rest, therefore, while Johnny related what had
passed between himself and the clergyman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas hard to shake sense into the old
gen&rsquo;leman.&nbsp; He doan&rsquo;t want to believe it, though
theer&rsquo;s his open Bible staring him in the face every day of
his life.&nbsp; But a man&rsquo;s reason be nought against the
pull of conscience; so he&rsquo;m gwaine up-along to see for
hisself.&nbsp; Then, if the things do appear to his sight,
he&rsquo;ll go forth in the name of the Lord to quench
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never do it&mdash;such a timorous man as
him,&rdquo; said Mrs. Pearn; but Cramphorn assured her that the
deed was done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ve gone to-night.&nbsp; I started along with
un.&nbsp; &lsquo;Shall I come with &rsquo;e, your
reverence?&rsquo; I axed him.&nbsp; An&rsquo; he said
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; though he&rsquo;d have liked to say
&lsquo;Ess.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Who wants man&rsquo;s aid if his
hand be in his Master&rsquo;s?&rsquo; he sez to me.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Not your reverence, that&rsquo;s sartain,&rsquo; I sez to
him.&nbsp; Then he went up-along and I comed in here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conversation continued and then, some half an hour later, a
little man in clerical costume, with tiny <a

shook beneath him, suddenly entered the inn.&nbsp; He was very
pale and blinked at the blazing oil lamp above the bar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis his reverence&rsquo;s self!&rdquo; cried
Mrs. Pearn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No less, my good woman, no less.&nbsp; A glass of your
best brandy, please.&nbsp; I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;m gallied&mdash;you&rsquo;m likewise
skeered.&nbsp; I see it in your worshipful manner of shaking
below the knee.&nbsp; I wish to God you had let me go along with
&rsquo;e.&nbsp; But, my stars! you must have comed down Red Hill
properly quick, if so be you went to the top of un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did descend quickly, John Cramphorn.&nbsp; I have no
hesitation in declaring that never have I come down that hill so
fast before.&nbsp; The Lord looked to it that I dashed not my
foot against a stone.&nbsp; And, furthermore, this apparition is
no mere conceit of ignorance or bucolic fancy; I myself, my
friends, have seen it; and I heartily wish that I had not done
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pass the glass to his reverence, Jenifer, will
&rsquo;e; an&rsquo; get you out of the armchair, Toby, an&rsquo;
let minister come by the fire.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve put in hot water
an&rsquo; sugar an&rsquo; the brandy be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped.&nbsp; All men knew the brandy of the
&ldquo;Golden Anchor,&rdquo; but it was not considered good
manners to criticise it.</p>
<p>Mr. Yates drank, then colour returned to his <a
name="page344"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 344</span>little grey
face and he passed his glass for a second dose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could discourse upon this theme at very considerable
length,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but the matter calls for deeds
rather than words, or perhaps I should say both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt, as a man of God, your duty do lie clear afore
you, if I may say so respectful,&rdquo; ventured Robert Bluett;
and the pastor admitted that it was so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the help of Heaven these unhappy beings, that here
dwell midway between earth and heaven, must be laid to
rest,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thaumaturgy, or working of
miracles, can only still subsist at the desire of Jehovah, and if
He wills that I liberate these funereal spirits to their rest, I
can do it, not otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lay you&rsquo;ll do it, such a holy man as
you,&rdquo; foretold Johnny Cramphorn, genially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, for God&rsquo;s love, don&rsquo;t mess it
up,&rdquo; added Mr. Bluett, &ldquo;&rsquo;cause if you make any
error, they&rsquo;ll rend &rsquo;e to tatters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Heaven wills and my health permits, I go on Tuesday
night in all the dignity and power of my calling,&rdquo; declared
Parson Yates; &ldquo;and now I will thank you to see me home,
such among you as journey on my way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few men departed with their pastor; <a
name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 345</span>Cramphorn
settled to his last pipe and glass beside the fire; and Robert
Bluett went upon his nocturnal duties.&nbsp; For, since his
arrival, things were mightily changed at Daleham; keen eyes never
closed on sea or land; most perfect cordons had been established
and a sure system extended far to east and west.&nbsp; It was
admitted that with such parole of cliffs and coombs, such
searching scrutiny by night and day of every dark lane, lonely
road and seaward-facing cavern, that not so much as a runlet of
spirits could swim unrecorded into Daleham or ride out of it.</p>
<p>How Merry Jonathan under these distracting circumstances could
continue to be merry, his friends and neighbours wondered.&nbsp;
Indeed, twice within a week he had brought back from the sea
pollock and conger&mdash;his legitimate objects of pursuit at
this season.&nbsp; But that Jonathan Godbeer should sell fish was
a significant sign of the times, and already folks said that Mr.
Cramphorn was avenged.</p>
<h3><a name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
346</span>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<p>Gentle snow fell through a grey night as a party of men and
women marched up Red Hill upon the following Tuesday
evening.&nbsp; An invisible moon made all this clear.&nbsp;
Parson Yates led the way with his cassock hitched out of the snow
and with a stout boy on either side of him.&nbsp; One lad bore a
candle, and the other, a little bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Butivul night for a holy deed, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo;
said Mr. Cramphorn.&nbsp; Mrs. Pearn, Jenifer and Mr. Bluett
walked beside him and a dozen villagers accompanied them.&nbsp;
The matter, however, at their pastor&rsquo;s desire had been kept
as far as possible from the general ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope as you&rsquo;m lookin&rsquo; sharp to the roads
an&rsquo; the quay an&rsquo; Smugglers&rsquo; Lane as
usual,&rdquo; whispered Johnny to Robert Bluett.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Some long tongue be sure to blab this business; an&rsquo;
if the Frenchman&rsquo;s laying off, they might signal her in
to-night, &rsquo;stead of to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so much as a sea-otter could go from sea to shore
without one of my men would know it,&rdquo; answered the
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then a great load be off my mind, I assure
&rsquo;e.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page347"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 347</span>Red
Hill above Daleham was a sandstone bluff that sprang up near
three hundred feet abruptly from the sea, and, save at low tides,
deep water always ran beneath.&nbsp; Upon its head a rough
tonsure of wind-worn pine trees circled the grey ruins of
Stapledon manor-house, and inland therefrom extended the
fishermen&rsquo;s gardens and stretched two roads.&nbsp; One of
these ways led to Daleham Church and the country; the other was
that up which Parson Yates and his company now climbed from the
village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here will we stand,&rdquo; said the good man,
&ldquo;and should anything in the nature of a superhuman
visitation occur, you must light your candle, Richard Trout, and
you, Noah Collins, after I have lifted my voice the first time,
must strike upon the bell thrice&mdash;for each Person of the
Ever-blessed Trinity.&nbsp; And see no wax falls from the candle
on to my book, boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They drew up outside the belt of fir and all endured half an
hour of misery, for the snow, though slight, persisted and the
air and earth were bitter cold.&nbsp; Presently, however, the
snow thinned to scattered flakes, then stopped; a star stole out
and touched the white carpet with silver.&nbsp; Then came the
beat of the church clock telling ten, and, as if in answer, a
sigh ran through the woods, and gloomy figures moved beneath the
trees.</p>
<p><a name="page348"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
348</span>Silent as a dream and darker than night itself against
the snow, a black pageant crept from the forest, and crossed the
open land.&nbsp; One tall figure, above man&rsquo;s common
stature, moved in front and, following him, came horses that drew
a plumed hearse, while certain footmen moved orderly
behind.&nbsp; Then did Dick Trout, with shaking blue fingers,
strike tinder and make a flame, and Noah Collins prepared to beat
a triple tattoo upon his bell.&nbsp; Only Mr. Yates himself
unhappily failed at the critical pinch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it &rsquo;em; give it to &rsquo;em, my dear soul,
or they&rsquo;ll be gone!&rdquo; implored Mr. Cramphorn in
frantic accents.&nbsp; But the little man had dropped his book
from a numbed and shaking hand, and, by the time he had picked it
up again, the ghostly funeral was sweeping along the church road,
already half swallowed up by night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lacked the power of speech,&rdquo; stuttered Mr.
Yates.&nbsp; &ldquo;I cannot deny it&mdash;the spirit of fear
came upon me and I dropped my book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give &rsquo;em a broadside coming back, your
reverence&mdash;if &rsquo;tis true as they do come back,&rdquo;
suggested Bluett.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later a man approached by the road from the
church, and Cramphorn eagerly enquired of him whether he had seen
the funeral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funeral?&nbsp; No, I seed no funeral,&rdquo; answered
the <a name="page349"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
349</span>voice of Merry Jonathan.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be that Parson
Yates huntin&rsquo; ghostes again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have come to liberate these unhappy phantoms and so
far failed.&nbsp; They passed before I summoned presence of mind
to address them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Passed?&rsquo;&nbsp; When?&nbsp; Why for
didn&rsquo;t I see &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; snorted Johnny Cramphorn.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who
be the likes of you to see such holy things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jonathan growled and approached Jenifer and her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best you women come home, else you&rsquo;ll get your
noses frozen off, an&rsquo; the spirits won&rsquo;t thaw
&rsquo;em for &rsquo;e, &rsquo;cepting those at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us have no irreverence, Jonathan Godbeer,&rdquo;
said the clergyman.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will do better to add your
prayers to ours, that my courage may be sustained and my voice
strengthened for the coming ordeal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain of the smugglers did not answer, but strode forth
and walked over white ground lately traversed by the procession
of spirits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doan&rsquo;t &rsquo;e cross theer track, my dear
man,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Pearn; &ldquo;else ten to one
they&rsquo;ll blast &rsquo;e crooked for the rest of your
days!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But her caution came too late.&nbsp; Godbeer stood and gazed
upon the snow where the spectral hearse had passed.&nbsp; Then he
lifted his voice and shouted with all his might.</p>
<p><a name="page350"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
350</span>&ldquo;Gauger Bluett!&nbsp; Gauger Bluett!&nbsp; This
here be your job, not parson&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Quick, man,
quick!&nbsp; Ghostes or no ghostes, the snow&rsquo;s took their
shoe marks if I see right.&nbsp; Boots an&rsquo; hoofs an&rsquo;
wheels&mdash;no bogies them.&nbsp; Ha-ha! the spirits that passed
along here was inside the hearse, not outside!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Exciseman and others rushed forward to find Merry
Jonathan&rsquo;s words were true, for the new-fallen snow had
been trampled with feet of men and horses, and seamed with tracks
of heavy wheels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Theer now!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve often thought they rascals
might have &rsquo;e that way, Cap&rsquo;n,&rdquo; said Godbeer,
with deep concern.&nbsp; &ldquo;To think of the wickedness
o&rsquo; the world!&nbsp; Just come in the trees behind the
ruin.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tweern&rsquo;t my business, of course, but
more&rsquo;n wance walkin&rsquo; &rsquo;pon the beach below,
takin&rsquo; the air at low tide, I&rsquo;ve looked up at the
face of the cliff by night and fancied I seed ropes pulling
things up the precipice.&nbsp; Then I thought,
&lsquo;No&mdash;surely not.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t be no hookem-snivey
doings under darkness wi&rsquo; such a man as Cap&rsquo;n Bluett
amongst us.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jonathan grinned and the moon came out and touched his white
teeth.&nbsp; Cramphorn held up a lantern, and Bluett himself
uttered words not seemly for the ear of Parson Yates.</p>
<p>Then he turned to follow the direction of the smugglers&rsquo;
funeral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bid every honest man come along with me in <a
name="page351"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 351</span>the
King&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Them as have
done this deed shall smart for theer night&rsquo;s work
yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Us&rsquo;ll all help &rsquo;e heart an&rsquo; soul,
I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; declared Merry Jonathan.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;m a thought behind the rogues, I fear.&nbsp; But
what&rsquo;s that with right &rsquo;pon our side?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They scrambled and hastened along the rutted snow, and
Cramphorn and Godbeer commented in cheerful chorus on the event
as they trotted beside the furious officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I&rsquo;m fearin&rsquo; is that these scamps have
been at theer games all the week,&rdquo; gasped the aged Johnny
while he shuffled forward.&nbsp; &ldquo;Theer&rsquo;s a dark plot
against our good name, and while we&rsquo;ve all been
countin&rsquo; to rub it in to-morrow night, they&rsquo;ve run
theer cargo and hid it in the ruin of the Manor this longful
time&mdash;pulled it up the cliff an&rsquo; been takin&rsquo; it
away reg&rsquo;lar night after night, while honest men was on the
watch&mdash;some place else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Makes me near burst wi&rsquo; rage,&rdquo; said
Jonathan, &ldquo;an&rsquo; all them fine fellows ready, an&rsquo;
the cutter sailin&rsquo; about over the sea so butivul!&nbsp;
An&rsquo; perhaps the cargo was run that very night Cap&rsquo;n
Bluett comed amongst us at the &lsquo;Golden Anchor,&rsquo;
an&rsquo; told us what a great man he was.&nbsp; All
play-actin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; even my own girl Jenifer to come
home so frightened.&nbsp; To think a man&rsquo;s own girl would
deceive him so wicked!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page352"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
352</span>&ldquo;Wi&rsquo; Pastor Yates at his post tu,
tryin&rsquo; so hard to larn us all better!&rdquo; panted
Cramphorn.</p>
<p>Now ahead loomed a huge black object where crossways met at a
lonely spot nearly a mile inland.&nbsp; It was empty and proved
to be the skeleton of a farm waggon painted black, boarded up,
and adorned with tufts of shavings dipped in tar.&nbsp; The snow
had been trampled for twenty yards round about it and indications
of other wheels diverged landward on three sides into the
night.</p>
<p>Cramphorn, Godbeer and Robert Bluett, now far ahead of their
companions, stood before this spectacle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve done you, by G&mdash;!&rdquo; gasped the
old man.&nbsp; &ldquo;An&rsquo; to think of all your bold heroes
with theer swords an&rsquo; cutlasses an&rsquo; pistols a-sitting
freezing in every lane and by every drain an&rsquo; rat-hole
around the village!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis amazin&rsquo; such things be
allowed to fall out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer did not answer.&nbsp; He had seen the ancient and
Godbeer grin amiably each upon the other, and now his thick skull
appreciated the truth and he turned to chew his gall alone.</p>
<p>Merry Jonathan shouted after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten to one they&rsquo;ll tell &rsquo;e that Maypole
chap as walked in front of the funeral was a man by the name of
Godbeer.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t you b&rsquo;lieve it,
Cap&rsquo;n.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll never catch me an&rsquo; Master
Cramphorn in no such job.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page353"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
353</span>&ldquo;Though we&rsquo;ve made up our difference, as
becomes Christian men,&rdquo; declared Johnny.</p>
<p>Bluett turned and addressed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They cry loudest who cry last,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The stones be piled as&rsquo;ll hold you tight yet, you
bowldacious thieves; an&rsquo; the wood be seasoned as
you&rsquo;ll swing from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cramphorn wagged his beard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My stars!&nbsp; Hark to un!&nbsp; Theer&rsquo;s a sour
temper!&nbsp; Theer&rsquo;s sorry thanks for all we&rsquo;ve
done!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a very thankless generation for
sartain.&nbsp; Gimme your arm back-along, Merry.&nbsp; We&rsquo;m
most tu good to mix wi&rsquo; common men&mdash;you an&rsquo;
me&mdash;that&rsquo;s the naked truth of it.&rdquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
